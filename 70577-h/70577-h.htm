</div>

<p class='c012'>From <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> to <cite>John Gabriel Borkman</cite>, all
Ibsen’s plays, with one exception, succeeded each
other at intervals of two years. The single exception
was <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. The storm of obloquy
which greeted <cite>Ghosts</cite> stirred him to unwonted rapidity
of production. <cite>Ghosts</cite> had appeared in December
1881; already, in the spring of 1882, Ibsen, then living
in Rome, was at work upon its successor; and he
finished it at Gossensass, in the Tyrol, in the early
autumn. It appeared in Copenhagen at the end of
November.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Paulsen<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> relates an anecdote of the poet’s
extreme secretiveness during the process of composition,
which may find a place here: “One summer he
was travelling by rail with his wife and son. He was
engaged upon a new play at the time; but neither Fru
Ibsen nor Sigurd had any idea as to what it was about.
Of course they were both very curious. It happened
that, at a station, Ibsen left the carriage for a few
moments. As he did so he dropped a scrap of paper.
His wife picked it up, and read on it only the words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>‘The doctor says....’ Nothing more. Fru Ibsen
showed it laughingly to Sigurd, and said, ‘Now we will
tease your father a little when he comes back. He
will be horrified to find that we know anything of his
play.’ When Ibsen entered the carriage his wife
looked at him roguishly, and said, ‘What doctor
is it that figures in your new piece? I am sure he
must have many interesting things to say.’ But if
she could have foreseen the effect of her innocent jest,
Fru Ibsen would certainly have held her tongue. For
Ibsen was speechless with surprise and rage. When
at last he recovered his speech, it was to utter a torrent
of reproaches. What did this mean? Was he not
safe in his own house? Was he surrounded with
spies? Had his locks been tampered with, his desk
rifled? And so forth, and so forth. His wife, who
had listened with a quiet smile to the rising tempest
of his wrath, at last handed him the scrap of paper.
‘We know nothing more than what is written upon
this slip which you let fall. Allow me to return it to
you.’ There stood Ibsen crestfallen. All his suspicions
had vanished into thin air. The play on which
he was occupied proved to be <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>,
and the doctor was none other than our old friend
Stockmann, the good-hearted and muddleheaded reformer,
for whom Jonas Lie partly served as a model.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The indignation which glows in <cite>An Enemy of the
People</cite> was kindled, in the main, by the attitude adopted
towards <cite>Ghosts</cite> by the Norwegian Liberal press and the
“compact majority” it represented. But the image
on which the play rings the changes was present to
the poet’s long before <cite>Ghosts</cite> was written. On December
19, 1879—a fortnight after the publication of
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite>—Ibsen wrote to Professor Dietrichson:
“It appears to me doubtful whether better artistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>conditions can be attained in Norway before the intellectual
soil has been thoroughly turned up and
cleansed, and all the swamps drained off.” Here we
have clearly the germ of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. The
image so took hold of Ibsen that after applying it to
social life in this play, he recurred to it in <cite>The Wild
Duck</cite>, in relation to the individual life.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mood to which we definitely owe <cite>An Enemy of
the People</cite> appears very clearly in a letter to George
Brandes, dated January 3, 1882, in which Ibsen
thanks him for his criticism of <cite>Ghosts</cite>. “What are
we to say,” he proceeds, “of the attitude taken up by
the so-called Liberal press—by those leaders who
speak and write about freedom of action and thought,
and at the same time make themselves the slaves of
the supposed opinions of their subscribers? I am
more and more confirmed in my belief that there is
something demoralising in engaging in politics and joining
parties. I, at any rate, shall never be able to join a
party which has the majority on its side. Björnson
says, ‘The majority is always right’; and as a practical
politician he is bound, I suppose, to say so. I,
on the contrary, of necessity say, ‘The minority is
always right.’ Naturally I am not thinking of that
minority of stagnationists who are left behind by the
great middle party, which with us is called Liberal;
I mean that minority which leads the van, and pushes
on to points which the majority has not yet reached.
I hold that that man is in the right who is most closely
in league with the future.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same letter closes with a passage which foreshadows
not only <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>, but <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>:
“When I think how slow and heavy and dull
the general intelligence is at home, when I notice the
low standard by which everything is judged, a deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>despondency comes over me, and it often seems to me
that I might just as well end my literary activity at
once. They really do not need poetry at home; they
get along so well with the <cite>Parliamentary News</cite> and the
<cite>Lutheran Weekly</cite>. And then they have their party
papers. I have not the gifts that go to make a good
citizen, nor yet the gift of orthodoxy; and what I
possess no gift for I keep out of. Liberty is the first
and highest condition for me. At home they do not
trouble much about liberty, but only about liberties: a
few more or a few less, according to the standpoint of
their party. I feel, too, most painfully affected by
the crudity, the plebeian element, in all our public
discussion. The very praiseworthy attempt to make
of our people a democratic community has inadvertently
gone a good way towards making us a
plebeian community. Distinction of soul seems to be
on the decline at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So early as March 16, 1882, Ibsen announces to his
publisher that he is “fully occupied with preparations
for a new play.” “This time,” he says, “it will be a
peaceable production which can be read by Ministers
of State and wholesale merchants and their ladies, and
from which the theatres will not be obliged to recoil.
Its execution will come very easy to me, and I shall
do my best to have it ready pretty early in the
autumn.” In this he was successful. From Gossensass,
on September 9, he wrote to Hegel: “I have the
pleasure of sending you herewith the remainder of the
manuscript of my new play. I have enjoyed writing
this piece, and I feel quite lost and lonely now that it
is out of hand. Dr. Stockmann and I got on excellently
together; we agree on so many subjects. But
the Doctor is a more muddleheaded person than I
am, and he has, moreover, several other characteristics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>because of which people will stand hearing a good
many things from him which they might perhaps
not have taken in such very good part had they been
said by me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A letter to Brandes, written six months after the
appearance of the play (June 12, 1883), answers some
objection which the critic seems to have made—of what
nature we can only guess: “As to <cite>An Enemy of the
People</cite>, if we had a chance to discuss it I think we should
come to a tolerable agreement. You are, of course
right in urging that we <em>must</em> all work for the spread
of our opinions. But I maintain that a fighter at the
intellectual outposts can never gather a majority
around him. In ten years, perhaps, the majority may
occupy the standpoint which Dr. Stockmann held at
the public meeting. But during these ten years the
Doctor will not have been standing still; he will still
be at least ten years ahead of the majority. The
majority, the mass, the multitude, can never overtake
him; he can never have the majority with him. As
for myself, at all events, I am conscious of this incessant
progression. At the point where I stood when
I wrote each of my books, there now stands a fairly
compact multitude; but I myself am there no longer;
I am elsewhere, and, I hope, further ahead.” This is
a fine saying, and as just as it is fine, with respect to
the series of social plays, down to, and including,
<cite>Rosmersholm</cite>. To the psychological series, which
begins with <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, this law of progression
scarcely applies. The standpoint in each
is different; but the movement is not so much
one of intellectual advance as of deepening spiritual
insight.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Ibsen predicted, the Scandinavian theatres seized
with avidity upon <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. Between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>January and March 1883 it was produced in Christiania,
Bergen, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. It has
always been very popular on the stage, and was the
play chosen to represent Ibsen in the series of festival
performances which inaugurated the National Theatre
at Christiania. The first evening, September 1,
1899, was devoted to Holberg, the great founder of
Norwegian-Danish drama; <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>
followed on September 2; and on September 3
Björnson held the stage, with <cite>Sigurd Jorsalfar</cite>.
Oddly enough, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ein Volksfeind</cite></span> was four <a id='corrxii.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='old years'>years old</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xii.11'><ins class='correction' title='old years'>years old</ins></a></span>
before it found its way to the German stage. It was
first produced in Berlin, March 5, 1887, and has since
then been very popular throughout Germany. It has
even been presented at the Court Theatres of Berlin
and Vienna—a fact which seems remarkable when we
note that in France and Spain it has been pressed into
the service of anarchism, as a revolutionary manifesto.
When first produced in Paris in 1895, and again in
1899, it was made the occasion of anarchist demonstrations.
It was the play chosen for representation
in Paris on Ibsen’s seventieth birthday, March 29,
1898. In England it was first produced by Mr.
Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre on the
afternoon of June 14, 1893. Mr. Tree has repeated
his performance of Stockmann a good many times in
London, the provinces, and America. He revived the
play at His Majesty’s Theatre in 1905. Mr. Louis
Calvert played Stockmann at the Gentleman’s Concert
Hall in Manchester, January 27, 1894. I can find no
record of any performances of the play in America,
save German performances and those given by Mr.
Tree; but it seems incredible that no American actor
should have been attracted by the part of Stockmann.
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Een Vijand des Volks</cite></span> was produced in Holland in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>1884, before it had even been seen in Germany; and
in Italy, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Un Nemico del Popolo</cite></span> holds a place in the
repertory of the distinguished actor Ermete Novelli.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all Ibsen’s plays, <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is the
least poetical, the least imaginative, the one which
makes least appeal to our sensibilities. Even in <cite>The
League of Youth</cite> there is a touch of poetic fancy in
the character of Selma; while <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> is
sentimentally conceived throughout, and possesses in
Martha a figure of great, though somewhat conventional,
pathos. In this play, on the other hand, there
is no appeal either to the imagination or to the tender
emotions. It is a straightforward satiric comedy,
dealing exclusively with the everyday prose of life.
We have only to compare it with its immediate predecessor,
<cite>Ghosts</cite>, and its immediate successor, <cite>The
Wild Duck</cite>, to feel how absolutely different is the
imaginative effort involved in it. Realising this, we
no longer wonder that the poet should have thrown
it off in half the time he usually required to mature
and execute one of his creations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> takes a high place in
the second rank of the Ibsen works, in virtue of its
buoyant vitality, its great technical excellence, and
the geniality of its humour. It seems odd, at first
sight, that a distinctly polemical play, which took its
rise in a mood of exasperation, should be perhaps the
most amiable of all the poet’s productions. But the
reason is fairly obvious. Ibsen’s nature was far too
complex, and far too specifically dramatic, to permit
of his giving anything like direct expression to a
personal mood. The very fact that Dr. Stockmann
was to utter much of his own indignation and many
of his own ideas forced him to make the worthy
Doctor in temperament and manner as unlike himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>as possible. Now boisterous geniality, loquacity, irrepressible
rashness of utterance, and a total absence
of self-criticism and self-irony were the very contradiction
of the poet’s own characteristics—at any rate,
after he had entered upon middle life. He doubtless
looked round for models who should be his own
antipodes in these respects. John Paulsen, as we
have seen, thinks that he took many traits from Jonas
Lie; others say<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> that one of his chief models was
an old friend named Harald Thaulow, the father of
the great painter. Be this as it may, the very effort
to disguise himself naturally led him to attribute to
his protagonist and mouthpiece a great superficial
amiability. I am far from implying that Ibsen’s own
character was essentially unamiable; it would ill
become one whom he always treated with the utmost
kindness to say or think anything of the kind. But
his amiability was not superficial, effusive, exuberant;
it seldom reached that boiling-point which we call
geniality; and for that very reason Thomas Stockmann
became the most genial of his characters. He
may be called Ibsen’s Colonel Newcome. We have
seen from the letter to Hegel (p. x.) that the poet
regarded him with much the same ironic affection
which Thackeray must have felt for that other
Thomas who, amid many differences, had the same
simple-minded, large-hearted, child-like nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>In technical quality, <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is
wholly admirable. We have only to compare it with
<cite>Pillars of Society</cite>, the last play in which Ibsen had
painted a broad satiric picture of the life of a Norwegian
town, to feel how great an advance he had
made in the intervening five years. In naturalness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of exposition, suppleness of development, and what
may be called general untheatricality of treatment,
the later play has every possible advantage over the
earlier. In one point only can it be said that Ibsen
has allowed a touch of artificiality to creep in. In
order to render the peripety of the third act more
striking, he has made Hovstad, Billing, and Aslaksen,
in the earlier scenes, unnaturally inapprehensive of
the sacrifices implied in Stockmann’s scheme of reform.
It is scarcely credible that they should be so free and
emphatic in their offers of support to the Doctor’s
agitation, before they have made the smallest inquiry
as to what it is likely to cost the town. They think,
it may be said, that the shareholders of the Baths
will have to bear the whole expense; but surely some
misgivings could not but cross their minds as to
whether the shareholders would be prepared to do so.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='xlarge'>THE WILD DUCK.</span> <br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The first mention of <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> (as yet unnamed)
occurs in a letter from Ibsen to George
Brandes, dated Rome, June 12, 1883, some six months
after the appearance of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. “I
am revolving in my mind just now,” he says, “the
plan of a new dramatic work in four acts. From time
to time a variety of whimsies gathers in one’s mind,
and one wants to find an outlet for them. But as the
play will neither deal with the Supreme Court nor
with the Absolute Veto, nor even with the Pure Flag,
it can hardly count upon attracting much attention in
Norway. Let us hope, however, that it may find a
hearing elsewhere.” The allusion in this passage is
to the great constitutional struggle of 1880-84,
of which some account will have to be given in
the Introduction to <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>. The “Pure Flag”
agitation aimed at, and obtained, the exclusion from
the Norwegian flag of the mark of union with Sweden,
and was thus a preliminary step towards the severance
of the two kingdoms. The word which I have translated
“whimsies” is in the original <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>galskaber</i></span>, which
might be literally rendered “mad fancies” or “crazy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>notions.” This word, or <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>galskab</i></span> in the singular, was
Ibsen’s favourite term for his conceptions as they grew
up in his mind. I well remember his saying to me, while
he was engaged on <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, “I hope to
have some tomfoolery [<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>galskab</i></span>] ready for next year.”
Sometimes he would vary the expression and say
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>djœvelskab</i></span>, or “devilry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this particular “tomfoolery” we hear no more
for a full year. Then, at the end of June 1884, he
writes in almost identical terms to Brandes and to
Theodor Caspari, announcing its completion in the
rough. His letter to Caspari is dated Rome, June 27.
“All last winter,” he says, “I have been pondering over
some new whimsies, and have wrestled with them till
at last they took dramatic form in a five-act play which
I have just completed. That is to say, I have completed
the rough draft of it. Now comes the more
delicate elaboration, the more energetic individualisation
of the characters and their methods of expression.
In order to find the requisite quiet and solitude for
this work, I am going in a few days to Gossensass, in
the Tyrol.” This little glimpse into his workshop is
particularly interesting.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Gossensass he wrote to Hegel on September
2: “Herewith I send you the manuscript of my
new play, <cite>The Wild Duck</cite>, which has occupied me daily
for the past four months, and from which I cannot
part without a sense of regret. The characters in this
play, despite their many frailties, have, in the course
of our long daily association, endeared themselves to
me. However, I hope they will also find good and
kind friends among the great reading public, and not
least among the player-folk, to whom they all, without
exception, offer problems worth the solving. But the
study and presentation of these personages will not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>easy.... This new play in some ways occupies a
place apart among my dramatic productions; its
method of development [literally, of advance] is in
many respects divergent from that of its predecessors.
But for the present I shall say no more on this subject.
The critics will no doubt discover the points in question;
at all events, they will find a good deal to wrangle
about, a good deal to interpret. Moreover, I think
<cite>The Wild Duck</cite> may perhaps lure some of our younger
dramatists into new paths, and this I hold to be
desirable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The play was published on November 11, 1884, and
was acted at all the leading theatres of Scandinavia in
January or February 1885. Ibsen’s estimate of its
acting value was fully justified. It everywhere proved
itself immensely effective on the stage, and Hialmar,
Gina, and Hedvig have made, or greatly enhanced,
the reputation of many an actor and actress. Hialmar
was one of the chief successes of Emil Poulsen, the
leading Danish actor of his day, who placed the second
act of <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> in the programme of his farewell
performance. It took more than three years for
the play to reach the German stage. It was first acted in
Berlin in March 1888; but thereafter it rapidly spread
throughout Germany and Austria, and everywhere
took firm hold. It was on several occasions, and
in various cities, selected for performance in Ibsen’s
presence, as representing the best that the local theatre
could do. In Paris it was produced at the Théâtre
Libre in 1891, and was pronounced by Francisque
Sarcey to be “obscure, incoherent, insupportable,”
but nevertheless to leave “a profound impression.” In
London it was first produced by the Independent
Theatre Society on May 4, 1894, Mr. W. L. Abingdon
playing Hialmar, and Miss Winifred Fraser giving a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>delightful performance of Hedvig. The late Clement
Scott’s pronouncement on it was that “to make a fuss
about so feeble a production was to insult dramatic
literature and to outrage common sense.” It was
repeated at the Globe Theatre in May 1897, with
Mr. Laurence Irving as Hialmar and Miss Fraser
again as Hedvig. In October 1905 it was revived at
the Court Theatre, with Mr. Granville Barker as
Hialmar and Miss Dorothy Minto as Hedvig. Of
American performances I find no record. It has been
acted in Italy and in Greece, I know not with what success.
The fact that it has no part for a “leading lady”
has rendered it less of an international stock-piece than
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite>, <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, or even <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> marks
a reaction in the poet’s mood, following upon the
eager vivacity wherewith, in <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>,
he had flung his defiance at the “compact Liberal
majority,” which, as the reception of <cite>Ghosts</cite> had proved,
could not endure to be told the truth. Having said
his say and liberated his soul, he now began to ask
himself whether human nature was, after all, capable
of assimilating the strong meat of truth—whether
illusion might not be, for the average man, the only
thing that could make life livable. It would be too
much to say that the play gives a generally affirmative
answer to this question. On the contrary, its last lines
express pretty clearly the poet’s firm conviction that
if life cannot reconcile itself with truth, then life
may as well go to the wall. Nevertheless his very
devotion to truth forces him to realise and admit
that it is an antitoxin which, rashly injected at wrong
times or in wrong doses, may produce disastrous results.
It ought not to be indiscriminately administered
by “quacksalvers.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>Gregers Werle is unquestionably a piece of ironic
self-portraiture. In his habit of “pestering people,
in their poverty, with the claim of the ideal,” the poet
adumbrates his own conduct from <cite>Brand</cite> onwards, but
especially in <cite>Ghosts</cite> and <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. Relling,
again, is an embodiment of the mood which was
dominant during the conception of the play—the mood
of pitying contempt for that poor thing human nature,
as embodied in Hialmar. An actor who, in playing
the part of Relling, made up as Ibsen himself, has
been blamed for having committed a fault not only
of taste, but of interpretation, since Gregers (it is
maintained) is the true Ibsen. But the fact is that
both characters represent the poet. They embody
the struggle in his mind between idealism and cynical
despondency. There can be no doubt, however, that
in some measure he consciously identified himself with
Gregers. In a letter to Mr. Gosse, written in 1872, he
had employed in his own person the very phrase, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>den
ideale fordring</i></span>—“the claim of the ideal”—which is
Gregers' watchword. The use of this sufficiently
obvious phrase, however, does not mean much. Far
stronger evidence of identification is afforded by John
Paulsen<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> in some anecdotes he relates of Ibsen’s habits
of “self-help”—evidence which we may all the more
safely accept, as Herr Paulsen seems to have been unconscious
of its bearing upon the character of Gregers.
“Ibsen,” he says, “was always bent upon doing things
himself, so as not to give trouble to servants. His
ideal was ‘the self-made man.’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Thus, if a button
came off one of his garments he would retire to his
own room, lock the door, and, after many comical and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>unnecessary preliminaries, proceed to sew on the button
himself, with the same care with which he wrote the
fair copy of a new play. Such an important task he
could not possibly entrust to any one else, not even to
his wife. One of his paradoxes was that ‘a woman
never knew how to sew on a button so that it would
hold.’ But if he himself sewed it on, it held to all
eternity. Fru Ibsen smiled roguishly and subtly when
the creator of Nora came out with such anti-feminist
sentiments. Afterwards she told me in confidence, 'It
is true that Ibsen himself sews on his vagrant buttons;
but the fact that they hold so well is <em>my</em> doing, for,
without his knowledge, I always ‘finish them off,’
which he forgets to do. But don’t disturb his conviction:
it makes him so happy.'”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One winter day in Munich,” Herr Paulsen continues,
“Ibsen asked me with a serious and even
anxious countenance, ‘Tell me one thing, Paulsen—do
you black your own boots every morning?’ I was
taken aback, and doubtless looked quite guilty as I
answered, ‘No.’ I had a vaguely uncomfortable sense
that I had failed in a duty to myself and to society.
<a id='corrxxii.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='But'>‘But</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xxii.22'><ins class='correction' title='But'>‘But</ins></a></span> you really ought to do so. It will make you feel
a different man. One should never let others do what
one can do oneself. If you begin with blacking your
boots, you will get on to putting your room in order,
laying the fire, etc. In this way you will at last find
yourself an emancipated man, independent of Tom,
Dick, or Harry.’ I promised to follow his advice,
but have unfortunately not kept my word.” It is
evident that Ibsen purposely transferred to Gregers
this characteristic of his own; and the sentiments
with which Gina regards it are probably not unlike
those which Fru Ibsen may from time to time
have manifested. We could scarcely demand clearer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>proof that in Gregers the poet was laughing at
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Hedvig, Ibsen gave the name of his only <a id='corrxxiii.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sister'>sister,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xxiii.3'><ins class='correction' title='sister'>sister,</ins></a></span>
and in many respects she seems to have served as a
model for the character. She was the poet’s favourite
among all his relatives. “You are certainly the best
of us,” he wrote to her in 1869. Björnstjerne Björnson
said, after making her acquaintance, that he now understood
what a large element of heredity there was in
Ibsen’s bent towards mysticism. We may be sure that
Hedvig’s researches among the books left by the old
sea-captain, and her dislike for the frontispiece of Harrison’s
<cite>History of London</cite>, are remembered traits from
the home-life of the poet’s childhood. It does not
seem to be known who had the honour of “sitting for”
the character of Hialmar. Probably he is a composite
of many originals. Moreover, he is obviously a
younger brother of Peer Gynt. Deprive Peer Gynt
of his sense of humour, and clip the wings of his
imagination, and you have Hialmar Ekdal.</p>

<p class='c001'>I confess I do not know quite definitely what
Ibsen had in mind when he spoke of <cite>The Wild
Duck</cite> holding “a place apart” among his productions
and exemplifying a technique (for he is evidently
thinking of its technical development) “divergent”
from that of its predecessors. I should rather say
that it marked the continuation and consummation
of the technical method which he had been elaborating
from <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> onward. It is the first
example of what we may term his retrospective
method, in its full complexity. <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> and
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> may be called semi-retrospective;
something like half of the essential action takes
place before the eyes of the audience. <cite>Ghosts</cite> is
almost wholly retrospective; as soon as the past has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>been fully unravelled, the action is over, and only
the catastrophe remains; but in this case the past to
be unravelled is comparatively simple and easy of
disentanglement. <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is scarcely
retrospective at all; almost the whole of its action
falls within the frame of the picture. In <cite>The Wild
Duck</cite>, on the other hand, the unravelling of the past
is a task of infinite subtlety and elaborate art. The
execution of this task shows a marvellous and hitherto
unexampled grasp of mind. Never before, certainly,
had the poet displayed such an amazing power of
fascinating and absorbing us by the gradual withdrawal
of veil after veil from the past; and as every
event was also a trait of character, it followed that
never before had his dialogue been so saturated, as it
were, with character-revelation. The development
of the drama reminds one of the practice (in itself a
very bad practice) of certain modern stage-managers,
who are fond of raising their curtain on a dark scene,
and then gradually lighting it up by a series of
touches on the electric switchboard. First there
comes a glimmer from the right, then a flash from
the left; then the background is suffused with light,
so that we see objects standing out against it in profile,
but cannot as yet discern their details. Then
comes a ray from this batten, a gleam from that;
here a penetrating shaft of light, there a lambent
glow; until at last the footlights are turned on at
full, and every nook and cranny of the scene stands
revealed in a blaze of luminosity. But Ibsen’s
switchboard is far more subtly subdivided than that
of even the most modern theatre. At every touch
upon it, some single, cunningly-placed, ingeniously-dissembled
burner kindles, almost unnoticed save by
the most watchful eye; so that the full light spreads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>over the scene as imperceptibly as dawn grows into
day.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems to me, then, that <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> is a consummation
rather than a new departure. Assuredly
it marks the summit of the poet’s achievement (in
modern prose) up to that date. Its only possible
rival is <cite>Ghosts</cite>; and who does not feel the greater
richness, depth, suppleness, and variety of the later
play? It gives us, in a word, a larger segment of
life.</p>

<p class='c001'>No, no,—much obliged to you. I stick to tea

<p class='c001'>[<i>Bowing rather stiffly.</i>] Mr. Hovstad? You come

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Partly. About an article for the paper.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I supposed. I hear my brother is an extremely
prolific contributor to the <i>People’s Messenger</i>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, when he wants to unburden his mind on
one thing or another, he gives the <i>Messenger</i> the
benefit.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>To <span class='sc'>Hovstad</span>.</i>] But will you not——? [<i>Points

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, I am far from blaming him for writing
for the class of readers he finds most in sympathy
with him. And, personally, I have no reason to
bear your paper any ill-will, Mr. Hovstad.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I should think not.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One may say, on the whole, that a fine spirit of
mutual tolerance prevails in our town—an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>public spirit. And that is because we have a great
common interest to hold us together—an interest
in which all right-minded citizens are equally concerned——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes—the Baths.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just so. We have our magnificent new Baths.
Mark my words! The whole life of the town will
centre around the Baths, Mr. Hovstad. There can
be no doubt of it!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is just what Thomas says.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How marvellously the place has developed, even
in this couple of years! Money has come into circulation,
and brought life and movement with it.
Houses and ground-rents rise in value every day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And there are fewer people out of work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is true. There is a gratifying diminution
in the burden imposed on the well-to-do classes by
the poor-rates; and they will be still further
lightened if only we have a really good summer
this year—a rush of visitors—plenty of invalids, to
give the Baths a reputation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I hear there is every prospect of that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Things look most promising. Inquiries about
apartments and so forth keep on pouring in.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then the Doctor’s paper will come in very
opportunely.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Has he been writing again?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This is a thing he wrote in the winter; enlarging
on the virtues of the Baths, and on the excellent
sanitary conditions of the town. But at that time
I held it over.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah—I suppose there was something not quite
judicious about it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not at all. But I thought it better to keep
it till the spring, when people are beginning to
look about them, and think of their summer
quarters——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You were right, quite right, Mr. Hovstad.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Thomas is really indefatigable where the
Baths are concerned.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is his duty as one of the staff.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And of course he was really their creator.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Was he? Indeed! I gather that certain persons
are of that opinion. But I should have thought
that I, too, had a modest share in that undertaking.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is what Thomas is always saying.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No one dreams of denying it, Burgomaster. You
set the thing going, and put it on a practical basis;
everybody knows that. I only meant that the
original idea was the doctor’s.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, my brother has certainly had ideas enough
in his time—worse luck! But when it comes to
realising them, Mr. Hovstad, we want men of
another stamp. I should have thought that in
this house at any rate——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>And after all, Peter, I really don’t squander any

After living so long out of the world, I find it a

<p class='c001'>[<i>Standing still.</i>] The fact is, Peter, I really cannot

<p class='c001'>God forbid! I am not in the habit of “getting

<p class='c001'>At any rate you have an ingrained propensity
to taking your own course. And that, in a well-ordered

<p class='c001'>I come of humble folk, as you know; and I have

well enough that our oligarchy will denounce me

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You may find it no such bad thing to have us
small middle-class men at your back. We form
what you may call a compact majority in the town—when
we really make up our minds, that’s to
say. And it’s always well to have the majority
with you, Doctor.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No doubt, no doubt; but I can’t conceive that
any special measures will be necessary in this case.
I should think in so clear and straightforward a
matter——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, but all the same, it can do no harm. I
know the local authorities very well—the powers
that be are not over ready to adopt suggestions
from outsiders. So I think it wouldn’t be amiss
if we made some sort of a demonstration.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Precisely my opinion.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>A demonstration, you say? But in what way
would you demonstrate?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course with great moderation, Doctor. I
always insist upon moderation; for moderation
is a citizen’s first virtue—at least that’s my way
of thinking.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>We all know that, Mr. Aslaksen.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I think my moderation is generally recognised.
And this affair of the water-works is very
important for us small middle-class men. The
Baths bid fair to become, as you might say, a little
gold-mine for the town. We shall all have to live
by the Baths, especially we house-owners. So we
want to support the Baths all we can; and as I
am Chairman of the House-owners' Association——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And as I'm an active worker for the Temperance<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c013'><sup>[9]</sup></a>

that I'm a temperance man?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you’ll understand that I come in contact
with a great many people. And as I'm known
to be a prudent and law-abiding citizen, as you
yourself remarked, Doctor, I have a certain influence
in the town, and hold some power in my
hands—though I say it that shouldn’t.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I know that very well, Mr. Aslaksen.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, you see—it would be easy for me to
get up an address, if it came to a pinch.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>An address?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, a kind of vote of thanks to you, from the
citizens of the town, for your action in a matter
of such general concern. Of course it will have
to be drawn up with all fitting moderation, so as
to give no offence to the authorities and parties in

<p class='c001'>Yes, I am. He’s a decent enough fellow, but

<p class='c001'>Of course he smiled at what he thought my

think what your proposed alterations would
cost? From what the engineer said, I gathered
that the expenses would probably mount up to
several hundred thousand crowns.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At least. And what are we to do with the
Baths in the meanwhile? Are we to close them?
We should have no alternative. Do you think
any one would come here, if it got abroad that the
water was pestilential?</p>

<p class='c001'>And all this now, just now, when the Baths are
doing so well! Neighbouring towns, too, are not
without their claims to rank as health-resorts.
Do you think they would not at once set to work
to divert the full stream of visitors to themselves?
Undoubtedly they would; and we should be left
stranded. We should probably have to give up
the whole costly undertaking; and so you would
have ruined your native town.</p>

should make themselves unmistakably felt.</p>

<p class='c001'>The existing water-works are, once for all, a
fact, and must naturally be treated as such. But
when the time comes, the Directors will probably
not be indisposed to consider whether it may not
be possible, without unreasonable pecuniary sacrifices,
to introduce certain improvements.</p>

I cannot guide and direct affairs in the way I

Therefore—and on various other grounds—it is
of great moment to me that your statement

<p class='c001'>Yes, I must speak frankly to you for once.
Hitherto I have tried to avoid it, for I know how

truth, Thomas. You have no conception how
much you injure yourself by your officiousness.
You complain of the authorities, ay, of the
Government itself—you cry them down and maintain
that you have been slighted, persecuted. But
what else can you expect, with your impossible
disposition?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Thomas, you are an impossible man to

<p class='c001'>It was mine by right! Mine, and no one else’s!

I alone. For years I fought single-handed for

</div>

<p class='c001'>No doubt; but then the right time had not
come. Of course, in that out-of-the-world corner,
you could not judge of that. As soon as the

outlet for your pugnacity. You want to make
an onslaught on your superiors—that is an old
habit of yours. You cannot endure any authority
over you; you look askance at any one who holds
a higher post than your own; you regard him as
a personal enemy—and then you care nothing
what kind of weapon you use against him. But
now I have shown you how much is at stake for
the town, and consequently for me too. And
therefore I warn you, Thomas, that I am inexorable
in the demand I am about to make of
you!</p>

<p class='c001'>As you have not had the sense to refrain from
chattering to outsiders about this delicate business,
which should have been kept an official secret, of
course it cannot now be hushed up. All sorts of
rumours will get abroad, and evil-disposed persons

therefore be necessary for you publicly to contradict
these rumours.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course not; but an editor can’t always do as
he likes. He has often to humour people’s fancies
in minor matters. After all, politics is the chief
thing in life—at any rate for a newspaper; and if
I want the people to follow me along the path of
emancipation and progress, I mustn’t scare them
away. If they find a moral story like this down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>in the cellar,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c013'><sup>[11]</sup></a> they are all the more ready to take

<p class='c001'>Well—since our townsfolk of the poorer class

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>It is a pleasing evidence of public spirit—a most
pleasing evidence. I admit it is more than I

<p class='c001'>But I don’t understand——. It’s the Baths——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>At a rough provisional estimate, the alterations

    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s extremely difficult to say, Mr. Aslaksen.
But what would you have us do? Do you think
a single visitor will come here if we go about

that the place is pestilential, that the whole

<p class='c001'>In that case it’s simply inexcusable of Dr.

</div>

<p class='c001'>I'm sorry to say you are only speaking the

Baths and of our town.</p>

<p class='c001'>In my statement in the <i>People’s Messenger</i> I have
made the public acquainted with the essential
facts, so that all well-disposed citizens can easily
form their own judgment. From that statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>it will be seen that the medical officer’s proposal—besides
amounting to a vote of censure upon
the leading men of the town—at bottom only
means saddling the ratepayers with an unnecessary
outlay of at least a hundred thousand
crowns.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Ringing the bell.</i>] Order, gentlemen! I must
beg leave to support the Burgomaster’s resolution.
I quite agree with him that there is something
beneath the surface of the Doctor’s agitation. In
all his talk about the Baths, it is really a revolution
he is aiming at; he wants to effect a redistribution
of power. No one doubts the excellence
of Dr. Stockmann’s intentions—of course there
cannot be two opinions as to that. I, too, am in
favour of self-government by the people, if only it
doesn’t cost the ratepayers too much. But in
this case it would do so; and therefore I'll be
hanged if—excuse me—in short, I cannot go with
Dr. Stockmann upon this occasion. You can buy
even gold too dear; that’s my opinion.</p>

<div class='c019'>[<i>Loud applause on all sides.</i></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I, too feel bound to explain my attitude. Dr.
Stockmann’s agitation seemed at first to find
favour in several quarters, and I supported it as
impartially as I could. But it presently appeared
that we had been misled by a false representation
of the facts——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, an untrustworthy representation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>This the Burgomaster’s report has proved. I
trust no one here present doubts my liberal
principles; the attitude of the <i>Messenger</i> on all
great political questions is well known to you all.
But I have learned from men of judgment and
experience that in purely local matters a paper
must observe a certain amount of caution.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And in the matter under discussion it is quite
evident that Dr. Stockmann has public opinion
against him. But, gentlemen, what is an editor’s
clearest and most imperative duty? Is it not to
work in harmony with his readers? Has he not
in some sort received a tacit mandate to further
assiduously and unweariedly the interests of his
constituents? Or am I mistaken in this?</p>

<p class='c001'>It has cost me a bitter struggle to break with a
man in whose house I have of late been a frequent
guest—with a man who, up to this day, has enjoyed
the unqualified goodwill of his fellow
citizens—with a man whose only, or, at any rate,
whose chief fault is that he consults his heart
rather than his head.</p>

me to break with him. Then, too, there

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes, you may believe me or not, as you
please; but truths are by no means the wiry
Methusalehs some people think them. A normally-constituted
truth lives—let us say—as a
rule, seventeen or eighteen years; at the outside
twenty; very seldom more. And truths so
patriarchal as that are always shockingly
emaciated; yet it’s not till then that the
majority takes them up and recommends them
to society as wholesome food. I can assure you
there’s not much nutriment in that sort of fare;
you may take my word as a doctor for that. All
these majority-truths are like last year’s salt pork;
they’re like rancid, mouldy ham, producing all the

<p class='c001'>[<i>Reflecting.</i>] No, upon my soul, you’re right there;
you’ve never had the frankness to do that. Well,
well, I won’t put you on the rack, Mr. Hovstad.
Let me be the freethinker then. And now I'll
make it clear to you all, and on scientific grounds
too, that the <i>Messenger</i> is leading you shamefully
by the nose, when it tells you that you, the masses,
the crowd, are the true pith of the people. I tell
you that’s only a newspaper lie. The masses are
nothing but the raw material that must be fashioned
into a People.</p>

<p class='c001'>Is it not so with all other living creatures? What
a difference between a cultivated and an uncultivated
breed of animals! Just look at a common
barn-door hen. What meat do you get from such
a skinny carcase? Not much, I can tell you! And
what sort of eggs does she lay? A decent crow
or raven can lay nearly as good. Then take a cultivated
Spanish or Japanese hen, or take a fine
pheasant or turkey—ah! then you’ll see the difference!
And now look at the dog, our near relation.
Think first of an ordinary vulgar cur—I
mean one of those wretched, ragged, plebeian
mongrels that haunt the gutters, and soil the sidewalks.
Then place such a mongrel by the side of
a poodle-dog, descended through many generations
from an aristocratic stock, who have lived on delicate
food, and heard harmonious voices and music.
Do you think the brain of the poodle isn’t very
differently developed from that of the mongrel?
Yes, you may be sure it is! It’s well-bred poodle-pups
like this that jugglers train to perform the
most marvellous tricks. A common peasant-cur
could never learn anything of the sort—not if he
tried till doomsday.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>like it or not. But truly there are few enough
aristocratic animals among us. Oh, there’s a terrible
difference between poodle-men and mongrel-men!
And the ridiculous part of it is, that Mr. Hovstad
quite agrees with me so long as it’s four-legged
animals we’re talking of——</p>

law to two-legged animals, than Mr. Hovstad stops
short; then he daren’t hold his own opinions, or
think out his own thoughts; then he turns the
whole principle upside down, and proclaims in the
<i>People’s Messenger</i> that the barn-door hen and the
gutter-mongrel are precisely the finest specimens
in the menagerie. But that’s always the way, so

I say it’s absolutely unpardonable of the <i>Messenger</i>
to proclaim, day out, day in, the false doctrine
that it’s the masses, the multitude, the compact

that vice and corruption and all sorts of

And yet this same <i>Messenger</i> can preach about
elevating the masses and the multitude to a higher

of the masses would simply mean hurling them
straight to perdition! But, happily, the notion
that culture demoralises is nothing but an old traditional
lie. No it’s stupidity, poverty, the ugliness
of life, that do the devil’s work! In a house that
isn’t aired and swept every day—my wife maintains
that the floors ought to be scrubbed too, but
perhaps that is going too far;—well,—in such a
house, I say, within two or three years, people lose
the power of thinking or acting morally. Lack of
oxygen enervates the conscience. And there
seems to be precious little oxygen in many and
many a house in this town, since the whole compact

<p class='c001'>A man should never put on his best trousers

Well, I don’t care so much about the trousers;

six of one and half a dozen of the other. Well,
never mind; let the curs yelp; <em class='gesperrt'>that’s</em> not the
worst; the worst is that every one, all over the
country, is the slave of his party. Not that I
suppose—very likely it’s no better in the free
West either; the compact majority, and enlightened
public opinion, and all the other devil’s
trash is rampant there too. But you see the conditions
are larger there than here; they may kill
you, but they don’t slow-torture you; they don’t
screw up a free soul in a vice, as they do at home
here. And then, if need be, you can keep out of
it all. [<i>Walks up and down.</i>] If I only knew of

<p class='c001'>[<i>Comes to a standstill.</i>] What an extraordinary

<p class='c001'>Yes, isn’t it extraordinary, this piggish

something! Look, here are all the stones they
threw in at us. Only look at them? Upon my
soul there aren’t more than two decent-sized
lumps in the whole heap; the rest are nothing
but pebbles—mere gravel. They stood down
there, and yelled, and swore they’d half kill me;—but

<p class='c001'>So I do, of course. But it’s depressing all the

would be for taking to its heels, and the compact

of sheep, Captain Horster. <em class='gesperrt'>That</em> is what’s so
melancholy to think of; it grieves me to the

<p class='c001'>Well, it’s this: now that we know how the

    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>You can venture to <em class='gesperrt'>now</em>, eh? But how about
public opinion? Aren’t you afraid of bringing down
a storm upon us?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Aslaksen.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>And you must be ready to put about quickly,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>As soon as my father-in-law and I have bought

<p class='c001'>I presume it is mainly on scientific grounds that

    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course; it was on scientific grounds that I
got the old Badger to stand in with me. And then
we’ll tinker up the water-works a little, and potter
about a bit down at the beach, without its costing
the town sixpence. That ought to do the business?
Eh?</p>

<p class='c001'>Of course, we should prefer to give you our

<p class='c001'>Yes, you are the man for that; if I don’t come

so simple, so clear and straightforward. I only
want to drive it into the heads of these curs that
the Liberals are the craftiest foes free men have
to face; that party-programmes wring the necks
of all young and living truths; that considerations
of expediency turn justice and morality
upside down, until life here becomes simply
unlivable. Come, Captain Horster, don’t you
think I shall be able to make the people

party-leaders that must be exterminated. For a
party-leader is just like a wolf, you see—like a
ravening wolf; he must devour a certain number
of smaller animals a year, if he’s to exist at all.
Just look at Hovstad and Aslaksen! How many
small animals they polish off—or at least mangle
and maim, so that they’re fit for nothing else but
to be house-owners and subscribers to the <i>People’s

<h3 class='c011'>ACT FIRST.</h3>

<p class='c020'><i>At</i> <span class='sc'>Werle’s</span> <i>house. A richly and comfortably
furnished study; bookcases and upholstered
furniture; a writing-table, with papers and documents,
in the centre of the room; lighted lamps
with green shades, giving a subdued light. At
the back, open folding-doors with curtains drawn
back. Within is seen a large and handsome room,
brilliantly lighted with lamps and branching
candlesticks. In front, on the right (in the study),
a small baize door leads into</i> <span class='sc'>Werle’s</span> <i>office.
On the left, in front, a fireplace with a glowing
coal fire, and farther back a double door leading
into the dining-room.</i></p>

<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Werle’s</span> <i>servant,</i> <span class='sc'>Pettersen</span>, <i>in livery, and <span class='sc'>Jensen</span>,
the hired waiter, in black, are putting the study
in order. In the large room, two or three other
hired waiters are moving about, arranging things
and lighting more candles. From the dining-room,
the hum of conversation and laughter of many
voices are heard; a glass is tapped with a knife;
silence follows, and a toast is proposed; shouts of
“Bravo!” and then again a buzz of conversation.</i></p>

<p class='c001'>No, he’s only an outside hand that does odd

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jensen.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>You can see he’s been through a lot.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Pettersen.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; he was an army officer, you know.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Pettersen.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>No mistake about it. But then he went into
the timber trade or something of the sort. They
say he once played Mr. Werle a very nasty trick.
They were partners in the Höidal works at the
time. Oh, I know old Ekdal well, I do. Many
a nip of bitters and bottle of ale we two have
drunk at Madam Eriksen’s.</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Pettersen.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, bless you, Jensen, it’s me that stands
treat. I always think there’s no harm in being a
bit civil to folks that have seen better days.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Jensen.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Don’t let us talk of it, old fellow. Of course
my poor unhappy father lives with me. He
hasn’t another soul in the world to care for him.

<p class='c001'>[<i>With a little sigh.</i>] Oh yes, I am; I have really

I felt it a little strange. It was such a totally new

<p class='c001'>In short, I thought it best to break, once for

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, you surely knew that, didn’t you? Where
do you suppose I found the money to learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>photography, and to furnish a studio and make a

you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, my dear fellow, didn’t you know? I

about it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a word about <em class='gesperrt'>his</em> part in the business. He
must have forgotten it. Our correspondence has
always been purely a business one. So it was my
father that——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certainly. He didn’t wish it to be
generally known; but he it was.  And of course
it was he, too, that put me in a position to marry.
Don’t you—don’t you know about that either?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I haven’t heard a word of it. [<i>Shakes him
by the arm.</i>] But, my dear Hialmar, I can’t tell
you what pleasure all this gives me—pleasure, and
self-reproach. I have perhaps done my father
injustice after all—in some things. This proves
that he has a heart. It shows a sort of compunction——</p>

    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes—whatever you like to call it. Oh, I
can’t tell you how glad I am to hear this of father.—So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>you are a married man, Hialmar! That is

    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, thoroughly happy. She is as good and

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, exactly. But, my dear friend, I'm quite
sure your father told you that I was married.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Who has risen.</i>] Oh yes, he mentioned it; but
not that—— [<i>Walking about the room.</i>] Stay—perhaps
he did—now that I think of it. My
father always writes such short letters. [<i>Half
seats himself on the arm of the chair.</i>] Now, tell
me, Hialmar—this is interesting—how did you
come to know Gina—your wife?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The simplest thing in the world. You know
Gina did not stay here long; everything was so
much upset at that time, owing to your mother’s
illness and so forth, that Gina was not equal to it
all; so she gave notice and left. That was the
year before your mother died—or it may have
been the same year.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was the same year. I was up at the works
then. But afterwards——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, Gina lived at home with her mother,
Madam Hansen, an excellent hard-working
woman, who kept a little eating-house. She
had a room to let too; a very nice comfortable
room.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; in fact, it was your father that recommended
it to me. So it was there, you see, that
I really came to know Gina.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then you got engaged?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. It doesn’t take young people long to fall

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Rises and moves about a little.</i>] Tell me: was it
after your engagement—was it then that my
father—I mean was it then that you began to
take up photography?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, precisely. I wanted to make a start, and
to set up house as soon as possible; and your
father and I agreed that this photography business
was the readiest way. Gina thought so too. Oh,
and there was another thing in its favour, by-the-bye:
it happened, luckily, that Gina had learnt
to retouch.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Acquittal is acquittal. Why do you rake up these

<p class='c001'>Oh, I have my reasons. Now tell me: when

<p class='c001'>You wrote me a letter about that time—a business

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>My poor unhappy mother told me; and that the

<p class='c001'>No, it was all that she had to suffer and submit

    <div><span class='sc'>Werle.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, she had nothing to suffer or submit to; not
more than most people, at all events. But there’s
no getting on with morbid, overstrained creatures—that
I have learnt to my cost.—And you could
go on nursing such a suspicion—burrowing into all
sorts of old rumours and slanders against your own

your age you might find something more useful
to do.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then perhaps your mind would be easier than it

up at the works, year out and year in,

<p class='c001'>Yes. It would not involve our being constantly

<p class='c001'>The fact is, I am not so fit for work as I once

<p class='c001'>Listen, Gregers: there are many things that

<p class='c001'>Strange that you should guess that, Gregers.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You were telling me that you owed so many

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But we didn’t get the duck from Mr. Werle

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ekdal.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s Håkon Werle we have to thank for her, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>the same, Gina. [<i>To <span class='sc'>Gregers</span>.</i>] He was shooting
from a boat, you see, and he brought her down.
But your father’s sight is not very good now.
H'm; she was only wounded.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah! She got a couple of slugs in her body, I

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, two or three.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>She was hit under the wing, so that she couldn’t
fly.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And I suppose she dived to the bottom, eh?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ekdal.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Sleepily, in a thick voice.</i>] Of course. Always
do that, wild ducks do. They shoot to the
bottom as deep as they can get, sir—and bite
themselves fast in the tangle and seaweed—and
all the devil’s own mess that grows down there.
And they never come up again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>But <em class='gesperrt'>your</em> wild duck came up again, Lieutenant

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ekdal.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>He had such an amazingly clever dog, your

duck and fetched her up again.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Who has turned to <span class='sc'>Hialmar</span>.</i>] And then she

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not at once; at first your father took her
home. But she wouldn’t thrive there; so Pettersen
was told to put an end to her——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Ekdal.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Speaking more softly.</i>] That was how we got
her, you see; for father knows Pettersen a little;

him to hand her over to us.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, wonderfully well. She has got fat. You
see, she has lived in there so long now that she
has forgotten her natural wild life; and it all
depends on <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You are right there, Hialmar. Be sure you

your father is asleep.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, by-the-bye—you said you had a room to

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>You?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, Mr. Werle, <em class='gesperrt'>you</em>——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>May I have the room? If so, I'll take possession

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, with the greatest pleasure——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, Mr. Werle, I'm sure it’s not at all the sort

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, Gina! how can you say that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, because the room’s neither large enough

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That really doesn’t matter, Mrs. Ekdal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I call it quite a nice room, and not at all badly

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But remember the pair of them underneath.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>What pair?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, there’s one as has been a tutor——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s Molvik—Mr. Molvik, B.A.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then there’s a doctor, by the name of
Relling.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Relling? I know him a little; he practised for
a time up in Höidal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>They’re a regular rackety pair, they are. As
often as not, they’re out on the loose in the evenings;
and then they come home at all hours, and
they’re not always just——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One soon gets used to that sort of thing. I

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H'm; I think you ought to sleep upon it first,

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You seem very unwilling to have me in the

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gina.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no! What makes you think <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, you really behave strangely about it, Gina.
[<i>To <span class='sc'>Gregers</span>.</i>] Then I suppose you intend to
remain in the town for the present?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Putting on his overcoat.</i>] Yes, now I intend to

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And yet not at your father’s? What do you
propose to do, then?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah, if I only knew <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>, Hialmar, I shouldn’t
be so badly off! But when one has the misfortune
to be called Gregers—! “Gregers”—and
then “Werle” after it; did you ever hear
anything so hideous?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, I don’t think so at all.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ugh! Bah! I feel I should like to spit upon
the fellow that answers to such a name. But
when a man is once for all doomed to be Gregers—Werle
in this world, as I am——</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Laughs.</i>] Ha ha! If you weren’t Gregers

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, an amazingly clever dog; one that goes to

<p class='c001'>Oh well, you might not be much the wiser if
you did. It’s understood, then, that I move in
early to-morrow morning. [<i>To <span class='sc'>Gina</span>.</i>] I won’t
give you any trouble; I do everything for myself.
[<i>To <span class='sc'>Hialmar</span>.</i>] We can talk about the rest to-morrow.—Good-night,

<p class='c001'>Let him fancy so, then! Mr. Werle has done

<p class='c001'>And there’s an old bureau with drawers and

in. But the clock isn’t going now.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, when I get the chance. Most of them
are English though, and I don’t understand
English. But then I look at the pictures.—There
is one great big book called “Harrison’s History
of London.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It must be a hundred years old;
and there are such heaps of pictures in it. At the
beginning there is Death with an hour-glass and
a woman. I think that is horrid. But then there
are all the other pictures of churches, and castles,
and streets, and great ships sailing on the sea.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But tell me, where did all those wonderful things
come from?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, an old sea captain once lived here, and he
brought them home with him. They used to call
him “The Flying Dutchman.” That was curious,
because he wasn’t a Dutchman at all.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. But at last he was drowned at sea; and

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tell me now—when you are sitting in there looking
at the pictures, don’t you wish you could travel
and see the real world for yourself?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no! I mean always to stay at home and

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, not only that. I should love above everything
to learn to engrave pictures like those in the
English books.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H'm. What does your father say to that?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t think father likes it; father is strange
about such things. Only think, he talks of my
learning basket-making, and straw-plaiting! But
I don’t think <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> would be much good.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no, I don’t think so either.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But father was right in saying that if I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>learnt basket-making I could have made the new
basket for the wild duck.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, indeed she is; for she is a <em class='gesperrt'>real</em> wild fowl,

she has no one to care for, poor thing.</p>

<p class='c001'>No. The hens too, many of them, were

away from all her friends. And then there is so

<p class='c001'>It is not quite completed yet; but I am working

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. I will rescue the shipwrecked man. For
shipwrecked he was, by the very first blast of the
storm. Even while those terrible investigations
were going on, he was no longer himself. That
pistol there—the one we use to shoot rabbits with—has
played its part in the tragedy of the house
of Ekdal.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but he dared not use it. His courage
failed him. So broken, so demoralised was he
even then! Oh, can you understand it? He, a
soldier; he, who had shot nine bears, and who
was descended from two lieutenant-colonels—one
after the other of course. Can you understand
it, Gregers?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I cannot. And once more the pistol played a
part in the history of our house. When he had
put on the grey clothes and was under lock and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>key—oh, that was a terrible time for me, I can
tell you. I kept the blinds drawn down over both
my windows. When I peeped out, I saw the sun
shining as if nothing had happened. I could not
understand it. I saw people going along the
street, laughing and talking about indifferent
things. I could not understand it. It seemed to
me that the whole of existence must be at a
standstill—as if under an eclipse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>I felt like that too, when my mother died.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in such an hour that Hialmar Ekdal

<p class='c001'>Yes.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. At the decisive moment I won the victory
over myself. I remained in life. But I can assure
you it takes some courage to choose life under
circumstances like those.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Well, that depends on how you look at it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, indeed, it takes courage. But I am glad I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>was firm: for now I shall soon perfect my invention;
and Dr. Relling thinks, as I do myself, that
father may be allowed to wear his uniform again.
I will demand that as my sole reward.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> is what he meant about his uniform——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is what he most yearns for. You can’t
think how my heart bleeds for him. Every time
we celebrate any little family festival—Gina’s and
my wedding-day, or whatever it may be—in comes
the old man in the lieutenant’s uniform of happier
days. But if he only hears a knock at the door—for
he daren’t show himself to strangers, you
know—he hurries back to his room again as fast
as his old legs can carry him. Oh, it’s heartrending
for a son to see such things!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

finish your invention?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Come now, you mustn’t expect me to enter into
particulars like that. An invention is not a
thing completely under one’s own control. It
depends largely on inspiration—on intuition—and
it is almost impossible to predict when the inspiration
may come.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certainly, it is advancing. I turn it over in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>my mind every day; I am full of it. Every afternoon,
when I have had my dinner, I shut myself
up in the parlour, where I can ponder undisturbed.
But I can’t be goaded to it; it’s not a bit of good;
Relling says so too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you don’t think that all that business in
the garret draws you off and distracts you too
much?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No no no; quite the contrary. You mustn’t
say that. I cannot be everlastingly absorbed in
the same laborious train of thought. I must have
something alongside of it to fill up the time of
waiting. The inspiration, the intuition, you see—when
it comes, it comes, and there’s an end of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Hialmar, I almost think you have something
of the wild duck in you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Something of the wild duck? How do you
mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You have dived down and bitten yourself fast in
the undergrowth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Are you alluding to the well-nigh fatal shot that
has broken my father’s wing—and mine too?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not exactly to <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>. I don’t say that your wing
has been broken; but you have strayed into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>poisonous marsh, Hialmar; an insidious disease has
taken hold of you, and you have sunk down to die
in the dark.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I? To die in the dark? Look here, Gregers,
you must really leave off talking such nonsense.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Don’t be afraid; I shall find a way to help you
up again. I too have a mission in life now; I
found it yesterday.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s all very well; but you will please leave
<em class='gesperrt'>me</em> out of it. I can assure you that—apart from
my very natural melancholy, of course—I am as
contented as any one can wish to be.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your contentment is an effect of the marsh
poison.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now, my dear Gregers, pray do not go on about
disease and poison; I am not used to that sort
of talk. In my house nobody ever speaks to me
about unpleasant things.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c001'>It’s not good for me you see. And there <em class='gesperrt'>are</em>

<p class='c001'>That’s not true. Not at that time. Mr. Werle
did come after me, that’s a fact. And his wife
thought there was something in it, and then she
made such a hocus-pocus and hurly-burly, and she
hustled me and bustled me about so, that I left
her service.</p>

<p class='c001'>Well, then I went home. And mother—well,
she wasn’t the woman you took her for, Ekdal;
she kept on worrying and worrying at me about
one thing and another—for Mr. Werle was a

<p class='c001'>That’s just why I didn’t dare tell you anything,

had a house and home of your own.—And now
we’d got everything so nice and cosy about us;

<p class='c001'>Yes, we have known each other for many years.

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Sörby.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>You may well say that. But I have always

afford absolutely to throw herself away.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>Are you not in the least afraid that I may let

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Sörby.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, of course I have told him all about it

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your father knows every single thing that can,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>with any truth, be said about me. I have told
him all; it was the first thing I did when I saw

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Sörby.</span></div>
  </div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, for my part, Gina, I believe it’s wisest to
do as I've done. And Werle has no secrets either,
on his side. That’s really the great bond between
us, you see. Now he can talk to me as openly as
a child. He has never had the chance to do that
before. Fancy a man like him, full of health and
vigour, passing his whole youth and the best years
of his life in listening to nothing but penitential
sermons! And very often the sermons had for
their text the most imaginary offences—at least
so I understand.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

<p class='c001'>You can stay so far as that’s concerned. I shan’t
say a word more. But I wanted you to know that
I had done nothing secretly or in an underhand
way. I may seem to have come in for a great
piece of luck; and so I have, in a sense. But
after all, I don’t think I am getting any more than
I am giving. I shall stand by him always, and I
can tend and care for him as no one else can, now
that he is getting helpless.</p>

But there is one thing that is revolting to my

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>And what is that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is that—but I don’t know whether I ought
to express myself so unreservedly about your father.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, is it not exasperating to think that
it is not I, but he, who will realise the true
marriage?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because it is clearly the case. Isn’t the
marriage between your father and Mrs. Sörby
founded upon complete confidence, upon entire
and unreserved candour on both sides? They
hide nothing from each other, they keep no
secrets in the background; their relation is based,
if I may put it so, on mutual confession and absolution.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, is not that the whole thing? Did you
not yourself say that this was precisely the
difficulty that had to be overcome in order to
found a true marriage?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But this is a totally different matter, Hialmar.
You surely don’t compare either yourself or your
wife with those two——?  Oh, you understand
me well enough.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Say what you like, there is something in all this

rule the world.</p>

<p class='c001'>There is no doubt about it. At all events there
ought not to be; for in that very fact lies the
righteous retribution. He has hoodwinked a confiding

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Herr Paulsen uses the English words; but it will appear
from the sequel that Ibsen’s ideal was not so much the self-made
as the self-mended man.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. “Burgomaster” is the most convenient substitute for
“Byfogd,” but “Town Clerk” would perhaps be more nearly
equivalent. It is impossible to find exact counterparts in
English for the different grades of the Norwegian bureaucracy.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. The word “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">mådehold</span>,” in Norwegian, means both “moderation”
and “temperance.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. It will be remembered that Aslaksen figures in <cite>The League
of Youth</cite>, of which Stensgård is the central character. Stensgård,
we see, has justified Lundestad’s prophecy by attaining the
high administrative dignity of “Stiftamtmand,” here roughly
translated “Governor.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. The reference is to the continental feuilleton at the foot of
the page.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Literally, “unprovided-for.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. “Has no right” represents the Norwegian “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">tör ikke</span>”—the
phrase which, elsewhere in this scene, is translated “dare
not.” The latter rendering should perhaps have been adhered
to throughout; but in this passage the Norwegian words convey
a shade of meaning which is best represented by “has no right.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">De lokale forholde</span>”—the local conditions, or the circumstances
of the locality, a phrase constantly in Aslaksen’s mouth
in <cite>The League of Youth</cite>. In the present context it is about
equivalent to “the lie of the land.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. Gregers here uses the old-fashioned expression “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">havsens

“<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">havets bund</span>” or “<span lang="no" xml:lang="no">havbunden</span>.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c001'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. By Norwegian law, before a widower can marry again,

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive. Several instances of dubious ‘?’ marks have
been corrected, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>As noted below, on p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>, there is apparently a missing word in the
phrase ‘And even&nbsp;&nbsp;it were so...’, most likely ‘if’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,
and noted the following for Volume VIII. Each of these was corrected
in printing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>From <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> to <cite>John Gabriel Borkman</cite>, all
Ibsen’s plays, with one exception, succeeded each
other at intervals of two years. The single exception
was <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. The storm of obloquy
which greeted <cite>Ghosts</cite> stirred him to unwonted rapidity
of production. <cite>Ghosts</cite> had appeared in December
1881; already, in the spring of 1882, Ibsen, then living
in Rome, was at work upon its successor; and he
finished it at Gossensass, in the Tyrol, in the early
autumn. It appeared in Copenhagen at the end of
November.</p>

<p class='c001'>John Paulsen<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> relates an anecdote of the poet’s
extreme secretiveness during the process of composition,
which may find a place here: “One summer he
was travelling by rail with his wife and son. He was
engaged upon a new play at the time; but neither Fru
Ibsen nor Sigurd had any idea as to what it was about.
Of course they were both very curious. It happened
that, at a station, Ibsen left the carriage for a few
moments. As he did so he dropped a scrap of paper.
His wife picked it up, and read on it only the words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>‘The doctor says....’ Nothing more. Fru Ibsen
showed it laughingly to Sigurd, and said, ‘Now we will
tease your father a little when he comes back. He
will be horrified to find that we know anything of his
play.’ When Ibsen entered the carriage his wife
looked at him roguishly, and said, ‘What doctor
is it that figures in your new piece? I am sure he
must have many interesting things to say.’ But if
she could have foreseen the effect of her innocent jest,
Fru Ibsen would certainly have held her tongue. For
Ibsen was speechless with surprise and rage. When
at last he recovered his speech, it was to utter a torrent
of reproaches. What did this mean? Was he not
safe in his own house? Was he surrounded with
spies? Had his locks been tampered with, his desk
rifled? And so forth, and so forth. His wife, who
had listened with a quiet smile to the rising tempest
of his wrath, at last handed him the scrap of paper.
‘We know nothing more than what is written upon
this slip which you let fall. Allow me to return it to
you.’ There stood Ibsen crestfallen. All his suspicions
had vanished into thin air. The play on which
he was occupied proved to be <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>,
and the doctor was none other than our old friend
Stockmann, the good-hearted and muddleheaded reformer,
for whom Jonas Lie partly served as a model.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The indignation which glows in <cite>An Enemy of the
People</cite> was kindled, in the main, by the attitude adopted
towards <cite>Ghosts</cite> by the Norwegian Liberal press and the
“compact majority” it represented. But the image
on which the play rings the changes was present to
the poet’s long before <cite>Ghosts</cite> was written. On December
19, 1879—a fortnight after the publication of
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite>—Ibsen wrote to Professor Dietrichson:
“It appears to me doubtful whether better artistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>conditions can be attained in Norway before the intellectual
soil has been thoroughly turned up and
cleansed, and all the swamps drained off.” Here we
have clearly the germ of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. The
image so took hold of Ibsen that after applying it to
social life in this play, he recurred to it in <cite>The Wild
Duck</cite>, in relation to the individual life.</p>

<p class='c001'>The mood to which we definitely owe <cite>An Enemy of
the People</cite> appears very clearly in a letter to George
Brandes, dated January 3, 1882, in which Ibsen
thanks him for his criticism of <cite>Ghosts</cite>. “What are
we to say,” he proceeds, “of the attitude taken up by
the so-called Liberal press—by those leaders who
speak and write about freedom of action and thought,
and at the same time make themselves the slaves of
the supposed opinions of their subscribers? I am
more and more confirmed in my belief that there is
something demoralising in engaging in politics and joining
parties. I, at any rate, shall never be able to join a
party which has the majority on its side. Björnson
says, ‘The majority is always right’; and as a practical
politician he is bound, I suppose, to say so. I,
on the contrary, of necessity say, ‘The minority is
always right.’ Naturally I am not thinking of that
minority of stagnationists who are left behind by the
great middle party, which with us is called Liberal;
I mean that minority which leads the van, and pushes
on to points which the majority has not yet reached.
I hold that that man is in the right who is most closely
in league with the future.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The same letter closes with a passage which foreshadows
not only <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>, but <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>:
“When I think how slow and heavy and dull
the general intelligence is at home, when I notice the
low standard by which everything is judged, a deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>despondency comes over me, and it often seems to me
that I might just as well end my literary activity at
once. They really do not need poetry at home; they
get along so well with the <cite>Parliamentary News</cite> and the
<cite>Lutheran Weekly</cite>. And then they have their party
papers. I have not the gifts that go to make a good
citizen, nor yet the gift of orthodoxy; and what I
possess no gift for I keep out of. Liberty is the first
and highest condition for me. At home they do not
trouble much about liberty, but only about liberties: a
few more or a few less, according to the standpoint of
their party. I feel, too, most painfully affected by
the crudity, the plebeian element, in all our public
discussion. The very praiseworthy attempt to make
of our people a democratic community has inadvertently
gone a good way towards making us a
plebeian community. Distinction of soul seems to be
on the decline at home.”</p>

<p class='c001'>So early as March 16, 1882, Ibsen announces to his
publisher that he is “fully occupied with preparations
for a new play.” “This time,” he says, “it will be a
peaceable production which can be read by Ministers
of State and wholesale merchants and their ladies, and
from which the theatres will not be obliged to recoil.
Its execution will come very easy to me, and I shall
do my best to have it ready pretty early in the
autumn.” In this he was successful. From Gossensass,
on September 9, he wrote to Hegel: “I have the
pleasure of sending you herewith the remainder of the
manuscript of my new play. I have enjoyed writing
this piece, and I feel quite lost and lonely now that it
is out of hand. Dr. Stockmann and I got on excellently
together; we agree on so many subjects. But
the Doctor is a more muddleheaded person than I
am, and he has, moreover, several other characteristics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>because of which people will stand hearing a good
many things from him which they might perhaps
not have taken in such very good part had they been
said by me.”</p>

<p class='c001'>A letter to Brandes, written six months after the
appearance of the play (June 12, 1883), answers some
objection which the critic seems to have made—of what
nature we can only guess: “As to <cite>An Enemy of the
People</cite>, if we had a chance to discuss it I think we should
come to a tolerable agreement. You are, of course
right in urging that we <em>must</em> all work for the spread
of our opinions. But I maintain that a fighter at the
intellectual outposts can never gather a majority
around him. In ten years, perhaps, the majority may
occupy the standpoint which Dr. Stockmann held at
the public meeting. But during these ten years the
Doctor will not have been standing still; he will still
be at least ten years ahead of the majority. The
majority, the mass, the multitude, can never overtake
him; he can never have the majority with him. As
for myself, at all events, I am conscious of this incessant
progression. At the point where I stood when
I wrote each of my books, there now stands a fairly
compact multitude; but I myself am there no longer;
I am elsewhere, and, I hope, further ahead.” This is
a fine saying, and as just as it is fine, with respect to
the series of social plays, down to, and including,
<cite>Rosmersholm</cite>. To the psychological series, which
begins with <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, this law of progression
scarcely applies. The standpoint in each
is different; but the movement is not so much
one of intellectual advance as of deepening spiritual
insight.</p>

<p class='c001'>As Ibsen predicted, the Scandinavian theatres seized
with avidity upon <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. Between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>January and March 1883 it was produced in Christiania,
Bergen, Stockholm, and Copenhagen. It has
always been very popular on the stage, and was the
play chosen to represent Ibsen in the series of festival
performances which inaugurated the National Theatre
at Christiania. The first evening, September 1,
1899, was devoted to Holberg, the great founder of
Norwegian-Danish drama; <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>
followed on September 2; and on September 3
Björnson held the stage, with <cite>Sigurd Jorsalfar</cite>.
Oddly enough, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><cite>Ein Volksfeind</cite></span> was four <a id='corrxii.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='old years'>years old</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xii.11'><ins class='correction' title='old years'>years old</ins></a></span>
before it found its way to the German stage. It was
first produced in Berlin, March 5, 1887, and has since
then been very popular throughout Germany. It has
even been presented at the Court Theatres of Berlin
and Vienna—a fact which seems remarkable when we
note that in France and Spain it has been pressed into
the service of anarchism, as a revolutionary manifesto.
When first produced in Paris in 1895, and again in
1899, it was made the occasion of anarchist demonstrations.
It was the play chosen for representation
in Paris on Ibsen’s seventieth birthday, March 29,
1898. In England it was first produced by Mr.
Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket Theatre on the
afternoon of June 14, 1893. Mr. Tree has repeated
his performance of Stockmann a good many times in
London, the provinces, and America. He revived the
play at His Majesty’s Theatre in 1905. Mr. Louis
Calvert played Stockmann at the Gentleman’s Concert
Hall in Manchester, January 27, 1894. I can find no
record of any performances of the play in America,
save German performances and those given by Mr.
Tree; but it seems incredible that no American actor
should have been attracted by the part of Stockmann.
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><cite>Een Vijand des Volks</cite></span> was produced in Holland in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>1884, before it had even been seen in Germany; and
in Italy, <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><cite>Un Nemico del Popolo</cite></span> holds a place in the
repertory of the distinguished actor Ermete Novelli.</p>

<p class='c001'>Of all Ibsen’s plays, <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is the
least poetical, the least imaginative, the one which
makes least appeal to our sensibilities. Even in <cite>The
League of Youth</cite> there is a touch of poetic fancy in
the character of Selma; while <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> is
sentimentally conceived throughout, and possesses in
Martha a figure of great, though somewhat conventional,
pathos. In this play, on the other hand, there
is no appeal either to the imagination or to the tender
emotions. It is a straightforward satiric comedy,
dealing exclusively with the everyday prose of life.
We have only to compare it with its immediate predecessor,
<cite>Ghosts</cite>, and its immediate successor, <cite>The
Wild Duck</cite>, to feel how absolutely different is the
imaginative effort involved in it. Realising this, we
no longer wonder that the poet should have thrown
it off in half the time he usually required to mature
and execute one of his creations.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yet <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> takes a high place in
the second rank of the Ibsen works, in virtue of its
buoyant vitality, its great technical excellence, and
the geniality of its humour. It seems odd, at first
sight, that a distinctly polemical play, which took its
rise in a mood of exasperation, should be perhaps the
most amiable of all the poet’s productions. But the
reason is fairly obvious. Ibsen’s nature was far too
complex, and far too specifically dramatic, to permit
of his giving anything like direct expression to a
personal mood. The very fact that Dr. Stockmann
was to utter much of his own indignation and many
of his own ideas forced him to make the worthy
Doctor in temperament and manner as unlike himself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>as possible. Now boisterous geniality, loquacity, irrepressible
rashness of utterance, and a total absence
of self-criticism and self-irony were the very contradiction
of the poet’s own characteristics—at any rate,
after he had entered upon middle life. He doubtless
looked round for models who should be his own
antipodes in these respects. John Paulsen, as we
have seen, thinks that he took many traits from Jonas
Lie; others say<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c013'><sup>[2]</sup></a> that one of his chief models was
an old friend named Harald Thaulow, the father of
the great painter. Be this as it may, the very effort
to disguise himself naturally led him to attribute to
his protagonist and mouthpiece a great superficial
amiability. I am far from implying that Ibsen’s own
character was essentially unamiable; it would ill
become one whom he always treated with the utmost
kindness to say or think anything of the kind. But
his amiability was not superficial, effusive, exuberant;
it seldom reached that boiling-point which we call
geniality; and for that very reason Thomas Stockmann
became the most genial of his characters. He
may be called Ibsen’s Colonel Newcome. We have
seen from the letter to Hegel (p. x.) that the poet
regarded him with much the same ironic affection
which Thackeray must have felt for that other
Thomas who, amid many differences, had the same
simple-minded, large-hearted, child-like nature.</p>

<p class='c001'>In technical quality, <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is
wholly admirable. We have only to compare it with
<cite>Pillars of Society</cite>, the last play in which Ibsen had
painted a broad satiric picture of the life of a Norwegian
town, to feel how great an advance he had
made in the intervening five years. In naturalness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>of exposition, suppleness of development, and what
may be called general untheatricality of treatment,
the later play has every possible advantage over the
earlier. In one point only can it be said that Ibsen
has allowed a touch of artificiality to creep in. In
order to render the peripety of the third act more
striking, he has made Hovstad, Billing, and Aslaksen,
in the earlier scenes, unnaturally inapprehensive of
the sacrifices implied in Stockmann’s scheme of reform.
It is scarcely credible that they should be so free and
emphatic in their offers of support to the Doctor’s
agitation, before they have made the smallest inquiry
as to what it is likely to cost the town. They think,
it may be said, that the shareholders of the Baths
will have to bear the whole expense; but surely some
misgivings could not but cross their minds as to
whether the shareholders would be prepared to do so.</p>

  <h3 class='c014'><span class='xlarge'>THE WILD DUCK.</span> <br /> <br /> INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The first mention of <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> (as yet unnamed)
occurs in a letter from Ibsen to George
Brandes, dated Rome, June 12, 1883, some six months
after the appearance of <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. “I
am revolving in my mind just now,” he says, “the
plan of a new dramatic work in four acts. From time
to time a variety of whimsies gathers in one’s mind,
and one wants to find an outlet for them. But as the
play will neither deal with the Supreme Court nor
with the Absolute Veto, nor even with the Pure Flag,
it can hardly count upon attracting much attention in
Norway. Let us hope, however, that it may find a
hearing elsewhere.” The allusion in this passage is
to the great constitutional struggle of 1880-84,
of which some account will have to be given in
the Introduction to <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>. The “Pure Flag”
agitation aimed at, and obtained, the exclusion from
the Norwegian flag of the mark of union with Sweden,
and was thus a preliminary step towards the severance
of the two kingdoms. The word which I have translated
“whimsies” is in the original <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>galskaber</i></span>, which
might be literally rendered “mad fancies” or “crazy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xviii'>xviii</span>notions.” This word, or <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>galskab</i></span> in the singular, was
Ibsen’s favourite term for his conceptions as they grew
up in his mind. I well remember his saying to me, while
he was engaged on <cite>The Lady from the Sea</cite>, “I hope to
have some tomfoolery [<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>galskab</i></span>] ready for next year.”
Sometimes he would vary the expression and say
<span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>djœvelskab</i></span>, or “devilry.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Of this particular “tomfoolery” we hear no more
for a full year. Then, at the end of June 1884, he
writes in almost identical terms to Brandes and to
Theodor Caspari, announcing its completion in the
rough. His letter to Caspari is dated Rome, June 27.
“All last winter,” he says, “I have been pondering over
some new whimsies, and have wrestled with them till
at last they took dramatic form in a five-act play which
I have just completed. That is to say, I have completed
the rough draft of it. Now comes the more
delicate elaboration, the more energetic individualisation
of the characters and their methods of expression.
In order to find the requisite quiet and solitude for
this work, I am going in a few days to Gossensass, in
the Tyrol.” This little glimpse into his workshop is
particularly interesting.</p>

<p class='c001'>From Gossensass he wrote to Hegel on September
2: “Herewith I send you the manuscript of my
new play, <cite>The Wild Duck</cite>, which has occupied me daily
for the past four months, and from which I cannot
part without a sense of regret. The characters in this
play, despite their many frailties, have, in the course
of our long daily association, endeared themselves to
me. However, I hope they will also find good and
kind friends among the great reading public, and not
least among the player-folk, to whom they all, without
exception, offer problems worth the solving. But the
study and presentation of these personages will not be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xix'>xix</span>easy.... This new play in some ways occupies a
place apart among my dramatic productions; its
method of development [literally, of advance] is in
many respects divergent from that of its predecessors.
But for the present I shall say no more on this subject.
The critics will no doubt discover the points in question;
at all events, they will find a good deal to wrangle
about, a good deal to interpret. Moreover, I think
<cite>The Wild Duck</cite> may perhaps lure some of our younger
dramatists into new paths, and this I hold to be
desirable.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The play was published on November 11, 1884, and
was acted at all the leading theatres of Scandinavia in
January or February 1885. Ibsen’s estimate of its
acting value was fully justified. It everywhere proved
itself immensely effective on the stage, and Hialmar,
Gina, and Hedvig have made, or greatly enhanced,
the reputation of many an actor and actress. Hialmar
was one of the chief successes of Emil Poulsen, the
leading Danish actor of his day, who placed the second
act of <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> in the programme of his farewell
performance. It took more than three years for
the play to reach the German stage. It was first acted in
Berlin in March 1888; but thereafter it rapidly spread
throughout Germany and Austria, and everywhere
took firm hold. It was on several occasions, and
in various cities, selected for performance in Ibsen’s
presence, as representing the best that the local theatre
could do. In Paris it was produced at the Théâtre
Libre in 1891, and was pronounced by Francisque
Sarcey to be “obscure, incoherent, insupportable,”
but nevertheless to leave “a profound impression.” In
London it was first produced by the Independent
Theatre Society on May 4, 1894, Mr. W. L. Abingdon
playing Hialmar, and Miss Winifred Fraser giving a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>delightful performance of Hedvig. The late Clement
Scott’s pronouncement on it was that “to make a fuss
about so feeble a production was to insult dramatic
literature and to outrage common sense.” It was
repeated at the Globe Theatre in May 1897, with
Mr. Laurence Irving as Hialmar and Miss Fraser
again as Hedvig. In October 1905 it was revived at
the Court Theatre, with Mr. Granville Barker as
Hialmar and Miss Dorothy Minto as Hedvig. Of
American performances I find no record. It has been
acted in Italy and in Greece, I know not with what success.
The fact that it has no part for a “leading lady”
has rendered it less of an international stock-piece than
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite>, <cite>Hedda Gabler</cite>, or even <cite>Rosmersholm</cite>.</p>

<p class='c001'>There can be no doubt that <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> marks
a reaction in the poet’s mood, following upon the
eager vivacity wherewith, in <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>,
he had flung his defiance at the “compact Liberal
majority,” which, as the reception of <cite>Ghosts</cite> had proved,
could not endure to be told the truth. Having said
his say and liberated his soul, he now began to ask
himself whether human nature was, after all, capable
of assimilating the strong meat of truth—whether
illusion might not be, for the average man, the only
thing that could make life livable. It would be too
much to say that the play gives a generally affirmative
answer to this question. On the contrary, its last lines
express pretty clearly the poet’s firm conviction that
if life cannot reconcile itself with truth, then life
may as well go to the wall. Nevertheless his very
devotion to truth forces him to realise and admit
that it is an antitoxin which, rashly injected at wrong
times or in wrong doses, may produce disastrous results.
It ought not to be indiscriminately administered
by “quacksalvers.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>Gregers Werle is unquestionably a piece of ironic
self-portraiture. In his habit of “pestering people,
in their poverty, with the claim of the ideal,” the poet
adumbrates his own conduct from <cite>Brand</cite> onwards, but
especially in <cite>Ghosts</cite> and <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite>. Relling,
again, is an embodiment of the mood which was
dominant during the conception of the play—the mood
of pitying contempt for that poor thing human nature,
as embodied in Hialmar. An actor who, in playing
the part of Relling, made up as Ibsen himself, has
been blamed for having committed a fault not only
of taste, but of interpretation, since Gregers (it is
maintained) is the true Ibsen. But the fact is that
both characters represent the poet. They embody
the struggle in his mind between idealism and cynical
despondency. There can be no doubt, however, that
in some measure he consciously identified himself with
Gregers. In a letter to Mr. Gosse, written in 1872, he
had employed in his own person the very phrase, <span lang="no" xml:lang="no"><i>den
ideale fordring</i></span>—“the claim of the ideal”—which is
Gregers' watchword. The use of this sufficiently
obvious phrase, however, does not mean much. Far
stronger evidence of identification is afforded by John
Paulsen<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c013'><sup>[3]</sup></a> in some anecdotes he relates of Ibsen’s habits
of “self-help”—evidence which we may all the more
safely accept, as Herr Paulsen seems to have been unconscious
of its bearing upon the character of Gregers.
“Ibsen,” he says, “was always bent upon doing things
himself, so as not to give trouble to servants. His
ideal was ‘the self-made man.’<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c013'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Thus, if a button
came off one of his garments he would retire to his
own room, lock the door, and, after many comical and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>unnecessary preliminaries, proceed to sew on the button
himself, with the same care with which he wrote the
fair copy of a new play. Such an important task he
could not possibly entrust to any one else, not even to
his wife. One of his paradoxes was that ‘a woman
never knew how to sew on a button so that it would
hold.’ But if he himself sewed it on, it held to all
eternity. Fru Ibsen smiled roguishly and subtly when
the creator of Nora came out with such anti-feminist
sentiments. Afterwards she told me in confidence, 'It
is true that Ibsen himself sews on his vagrant buttons;
but the fact that they hold so well is <em>my</em> doing, for,
without his knowledge, I always ‘finish them off,’
which he forgets to do. But don’t disturb his conviction:
it makes him so happy.'”</p>

<p class='c001'>“One winter day in Munich,” Herr Paulsen continues,
“Ibsen asked me with a serious and even
anxious countenance, ‘Tell me one thing, Paulsen—do
you black your own boots every morning?’ I was
taken aback, and doubtless looked quite guilty as I
answered, ‘No.’ I had a vaguely uncomfortable sense
that I had failed in a duty to myself and to society.
<a id='corrxxii.22'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='But'>‘But</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xxii.22'><ins class='correction' title='But'>‘But</ins></a></span> you really ought to do so. It will make you feel
a different man. One should never let others do what
one can do oneself. If you begin with blacking your
boots, you will get on to putting your room in order,
laying the fire, etc. In this way you will at last find
yourself an emancipated man, independent of Tom,
Dick, or Harry.’ I promised to follow his advice,
but have unfortunately not kept my word.” It is
evident that Ibsen purposely transferred to Gregers
this characteristic of his own; and the sentiments
with which Gina regards it are probably not unlike
those which Fru Ibsen may from time to time
have manifested. We could scarcely demand clearer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>proof that in Gregers the poet was laughing at
himself.</p>

<p class='c001'>To Hedvig, Ibsen gave the name of his only <a id='corrxxiii.3'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sister'>sister,</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_xxiii.3'><ins class='correction' title='sister'>sister,</ins></a></span>
and in many respects she seems to have served as a
model for the character. She was the poet’s favourite
among all his relatives. “You are certainly the best
of us,” he wrote to her in 1869. Björnstjerne Björnson
said, after making her acquaintance, that he now understood
what a large element of heredity there was in
Ibsen’s bent towards mysticism. We may be sure that
Hedvig’s researches among the books left by the old
sea-captain, and her dislike for the frontispiece of Harrison’s
<cite>History of London</cite>, are remembered traits from
the home-life of the poet’s childhood. It does not
seem to be known who had the honour of “sitting for”
the character of Hialmar. Probably he is a composite
of many originals. Moreover, he is obviously a
younger brother of Peer Gynt. Deprive Peer Gynt
of his sense of humour, and clip the wings of his
imagination, and you have Hialmar Ekdal.</p>

<p class='c001'>I confess I do not know quite definitely what
Ibsen had in mind when he spoke of <cite>The Wild
Duck</cite> holding “a place apart” among his productions
and exemplifying a technique (for he is evidently
thinking of its technical development) “divergent”
from that of its predecessors. I should rather say
that it marked the continuation and consummation
of the technical method which he had been elaborating
from <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> onward. It is the first
example of what we may term his retrospective
method, in its full complexity. <cite>Pillars of Society</cite> and
<cite>A Doll’s House</cite> may be called semi-retrospective;
something like half of the essential action takes
place before the eyes of the audience. <cite>Ghosts</cite> is
almost wholly retrospective; as soon as the past has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>been fully unravelled, the action is over, and only
the catastrophe remains; but in this case the past to
be unravelled is comparatively simple and easy of
disentanglement. <cite>An Enemy of the People</cite> is scarcely
retrospective at all; almost the whole of its action
falls within the frame of the picture. In <cite>The Wild
Duck</cite>, on the other hand, the unravelling of the past
is a task of infinite subtlety and elaborate art. The
execution of this task shows a marvellous and hitherto
unexampled grasp of mind. Never before, certainly,
had the poet displayed such an amazing power of
fascinating and absorbing us by the gradual withdrawal
of veil after veil from the past; and as every
event was also a trait of character, it followed that
never before had his dialogue been so saturated, as it
were, with character-revelation. The development
of the drama reminds one of the practice (in itself a
very bad practice) of certain modern stage-managers,
who are fond of raising their curtain on a dark scene,
and then gradually lighting it up by a series of
touches on the electric switchboard. First there
comes a glimmer from the right, then a flash from
the left; then the background is suffused with light,
so that we see objects standing out against it in profile,
but cannot as yet discern their details. Then
comes a ray from this batten, a gleam from that;
here a penetrating shaft of light, there a lambent
glow; until at last the footlights are turned on at
full, and every nook and cranny of the scene stands
revealed in a blaze of luminosity. But Ibsen’s
switchboard is far more subtly subdivided than that
of even the most modern theatre. At every touch
upon it, some single, cunningly-placed, ingeniously-dissembled
burner kindles, almost unnoticed save by
the most watchful eye; so that the full light spreads
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>over the scene as imperceptibly as dawn grows into
day.</p>

<p class='c001'>It seems to me, then, that <cite>The Wild Duck</cite> is a consummation
rather than a new departure. Assuredly
it marks the summit of the poet’s achievement (in
modern prose) up to that date. Its only possible
rival is <cite>Ghosts</cite>; and who does not feel the greater
richness, depth, suppleness, and variety of the later
play? It gives us, in a word, a larger segment of
life.</p>

to the other rooms of the house. Against the
middle of this wall stands the stove; further forward
a sofa with a mirror above it, and in front
of it an oval table with a cover. On the table a
lighted lamp, with a shade. In the back wall an
open door leading to the dining-room, in which is
seen a supper-table, with a lamp on it.</i></p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Partly. About an article for the paper.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So I supposed. I hear my brother is an extremely
prolific contributor to the <i>People’s Messenger</i>.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, when he wants to unburden his mind on
one thing or another, he gives the <i>Messenger</i> the
benefit.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>To <span class='sc'>Hovstad</span>.</i>] But will you not——? [<i>Points

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, well, I am far from blaming him for writing
for the class of readers he finds most in sympathy
with him. And, personally, I have no reason to
bear your paper any ill-will, Mr. Hovstad.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I should think not.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>One may say, on the whole, that a fine spirit of
mutual tolerance prevails in our town—an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>public spirit. And that is because we have a great
common interest to hold us together—an interest
in which all right-minded citizens are equally concerned——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes—the Baths.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Just so. We have our magnificent new Baths.
Mark my words! The whole life of the town will
centre around the Baths, Mr. Hovstad. There can
be no doubt of it!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is just what Thomas says.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How marvellously the place has developed, even
in this couple of years! Money has come into circulation,
and brought life and movement with it.
Houses and ground-rents rise in value every day.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And there are fewer people out of work.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That is true. There is a gratifying diminution
in the burden imposed on the well-to-do classes by
the poor-rates; and they will be still further
lightened if only we have a really good summer
this year—a rush of visitors—plenty of invalids, to
give the Baths a reputation.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I hear there is every prospect of that.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Things look most promising. Inquiries about

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then the Doctor’s paper will come in very

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>This is a thing he wrote in the winter; enlarging
on the virtues of the Baths, and on the excellent
sanitary conditions of the town. But at that time
I held it over.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Ah—I suppose there was something not quite

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not at all. But I thought it better to keep
it till the spring, when people are beginning to
look about them, and think of their summer
quarters——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

</div>

<p class='c001'>No one dreams of denying it, Burgomaster. You
set the thing going, and put it on a practical basis;
everybody knows that. I only meant that the
original idea was the doctor’s.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, my brother has certainly had ideas enough

<p class='c001'>[<i>Standing still.</i>] The fact is, Peter, I really cannot

<p class='c001'>Yes, you may well say I've worked, Katrina.

<p class='c001'>You may find it no such bad thing to have us

<p class='c001'>Yes, but all the same, it can do no harm. I
know the local authorities very well—the powers

from outsiders. So I think it wouldn’t be amiss
if we made some sort of a demonstration.</p>

is a citizen’s first virtue—at least that’s my way
of thinking.</p>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I think my moderation is generally recognised.

important for us small middle-class men. The
Baths bid fair to become, as you might say, a little
gold-mine for the town. We shall all have to live
by the Baths, especially we house-owners. So we
want to support the Baths all we can; and as I

of such general concern. Of course it will have
to be drawn up with all fitting moderation, so as

</div>

<p class='c001'>Good morning, brother-in-law. How are you?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, thanks, so-so. [<i>To the <span class='sc'>Doctor</span>.</i>] Yesterday
evening, after office hours, I received from
you a dissertation upon the state of the water at
the Baths.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. Have you read it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have.</p>

    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

</div>

<p class='c001'>And what do you think of the affair?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>H'm—  <span class='float-right'>[<i>With a sidelong glance.</i></span></p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Mrs. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Come, Petra.</p>

<div class='c019'>[<i>She and <span class='sc'>Petra</span> go into the room on the left.</i></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>After a pause.</i>] Was it necessary to make all
these investigations behind my back?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, till I was absolutely certain, I——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And are you absolutely certain now?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My paper must surely have convinced you of
that.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Is it your intention to submit this statement to
the Board of Directors, as a sort of official document?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course. Something must be done in the
matter, and that promptly.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>As usual, you use very strong expressions in your
statement. Amongst other things, you say that
what we offer our visitors is a slow poison.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Why, Peter, what else can it be called? Only
think—poisoned water both internally and externally!
And that to poor invalids who come to us
in all confidence, and pay us handsomely to cure
them!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then you announce as your conclusion that
we must build a sewer to carry off the alleged impurities
from the Mill Dale, and must re-lay all
the water-pipes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. Can you suggest any other plan?—I
know of none.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I found a pretext for looking in at the town
engineer’s this morning, and—in a half-jesting
way—I mentioned these alterations as things
we might possibly have to consider, at some
future time.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At some future time!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Of course he smiled at what he thought my
extravagance. Have you taken the trouble to
think what your proposed alterations would
cost? From what the engineer said, I gathered
that the expenses would probably mount up to
several hundred thousand crowns.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So much as that?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. But that is not the worst. The work
would take at least two years.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Two years! Do you mean to say two whole
years?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>At least. And what are we to do with the
Baths in the meanwhile? Are we to close them?
We should have no alternative. Do you think
any one would come here, if it got abroad that the
water was pestilential?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But, Peter, that’s precisely what it is.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And all this now, just now, when the Baths are
doing so well! Neighbouring towns, too, are not
without their claims to rank as health-resorts.
Do you think they would not at once set to work
to divert the full stream of visitors to themselves?
Undoubtedly they would; and we should be left
stranded. We should probably have to give up
the whole costly undertaking; and so you would
have ruined your native town.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I—ruined——!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is only through the Baths that the town has
any future worth speaking of. You surely know
that as well as I do.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Then what do you think should be done?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have not succeeded in convincing myself that
the condition of the water at the Baths is as
serious as your statement represents.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I tell you it’s if anything worse—or will be in
the summer, when the hot weather sets in.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I repeat that I believe you exaggerate greatly.
A competent physician should know what measures
to take—he should be able to obviate deleterious
influences, and to counteract them in case they
should make themselves unmistakably felt.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed—? And then—?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The existing water-works are, once for all, a
fact, and must naturally be treated as such. But
when the time comes, the Directors will probably
not be indisposed to consider whether it may not
be possible, without unreasonable pecuniary sacrifices,
to introduce certain improvements.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And do you imagine I could ever be a party to
such dishonesty?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Dishonesty?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, it would be dishonesty—a fraud, a lie, an
absolute crime against the public, against society
as a whole!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I have not, as I before remarked, been able to
convince myself that there is really any such
imminent danger.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You have! You must have! I know that my
demonstration is absolutely clear and convincing.
And you understand it perfectly, Peter, only you
won’t admit it. It was you who insisted that both
the Bath-buildings and the water-works should be
placed where they now are; and it’s <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>—it’s
that damned blunder that you won’t confess.
Pshaw! Do you think I don’t see through you?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>

my reputation with a certain anxiety, I do it for
the good of the town. Without moral authority
I cannot guide and direct affairs in the way I
consider most conducive to the general welfare.
Therefore—and on various other grounds—it is
of great moment to me that your statement
should not be submitted to the Board of
Directors. It must be kept back, for the good
of the community. Later on I will bring up the
matter for discussion, and we will do the best
we can, quietly; but not a word, not a whisper,
of this unfortunate business must come to the
public ears.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I believe I have always shown myself ready and

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I ask for no thanks. Indeed, I was in some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>measure forced to act as I did—for my own sake.
I always hoped I should be able to keep you a
little in check, if I helped to improve your

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>In a measure, I say. It is painful for a man in

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, unfortunately, you do, without knowing it.
Yours is a turbulent, unruly, rebellious spirit. And
then you have an unhappy propensity for rushing
into print upon every possible and impossible
occasion. You no sooner hit upon an idea than
you must needs write a newspaper article or a
whole <a id='corr64.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='pamphet'>pamphlet</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_64.20'><ins class='correction' title='pamphet'>pamphlet</ins></a></span> about it.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, the public has no need for new ideas. The

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, I must speak frankly to you for once.
Hitherto I have tried to avoid it, for I know how
irritable you are; but now I must tell you the
truth, Thomas. You have no conception how
much you injure yourself by your officiousness.
You complain of the authorities, ay, of the
Government itself—you cry them down and maintain
that you have been slighted, persecuted. But
what else can you expect, with your impossible
disposition?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, Thomas, you are an impossible man to
work with. I know that from experience. You
have no consideration for any one or any thing;
you seem quite to forget that you have me to
thank for your position as medical officer of the
Baths——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was mine by right! Mine, and no one else’s!
I was the first to discover the town’s capabilities
as a watering-place; I saw them, and, at that time,
I alone. For years I fought single-handed for
this idea of mine; I wrote and wrote——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No doubt; but then the right time had not
come. Of course, in that out-of-the-world corner,
you could not judge of that. As soon as the
propitious moment arrived, I—and others—took
the matter in hand——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, and you went and bungled the whole of
my glorious plan. Oh, we see now what a set of
wiseacres you were!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Burgomaster.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>All <i>I</i> can see is that you are again seeking an
outlet for your pugnacity. You want to make
an onslaught on your superiors—that is an old
habit of yours. You cannot endure any authority
over you; you look askance at any one who holds
a higher post than your own; you regard him as
a personal enemy—and then you care nothing
what kind of weapon you use against him. But
now I have shown you how much is at stake for
the town, and consequently for me too. And
therefore I warn you, Thomas, that I am inexorable
in the demand I am about to make of
you!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>

and exaggerated statements should
get abroad as to the sanitary condition of the
Baths and of our town.</p>

<p class='c001'>In my statement in the <i>People’s Messenger</i> I have
made the public acquainted with the essential
facts, so that all well-disposed citizens can easily
form their own judgment. From that statement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>it will be seen that the medical officer’s proposal—besides
amounting to a vote of censure upon
the leading men of the town—at bottom only
means saddling the ratepayers with an unnecessary
outlay of at least a hundred thousand
crowns.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Ringing the bell.</i>] Order, gentlemen! I must
beg leave to support the Burgomaster’s resolution.
I quite agree with him that there is something
beneath the surface of the Doctor’s agitation. In
all his talk about the Baths, it is really a revolution
he is aiming at; he wants to effect a redistribution
of power. No one doubts the excellence
of Dr. Stockmann’s intentions—of course there
cannot be two opinions as to that. I, too, am in
favour of self-government by the people, if only it
doesn’t cost the ratepayers too much. But in
this case it would do so; and therefore I'll be
hanged if—excuse me—in short, I cannot go with
Dr. Stockmann upon this occasion. You can buy
even gold too dear; that’s my opinion.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I, too feel bound to explain my attitude. Dr.
Stockmann’s agitation seemed at first to find
favour in several quarters, and I supported it as
impartially as I could. But it presently appeared
that we had been misled by a false representation
of the facts——</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Dr. Stockmann.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hovstad.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well then, an untrustworthy representation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>This the Burgomaster’s report has proved. I
trust no one here present doubts my liberal
principles; the attitude of the <i>Messenger</i> on all
great political questions is well known to you all.
But I have learned from men of judgment and
experience that in purely local matters a paper
must observe a certain amount of caution.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And in the matter under discussion it is quite
evident that Dr. Stockmann has public opinion
against him. But, gentlemen, what is an editor’s
clearest and most imperative duty? Is it not to
work in harmony with his readers? Has he not
in some sort received a tacit mandate to further
assiduously and unweariedly the interests of his
constituents? Or am I mistaken in this?</p>

the unqualified goodwill of his fellow
citizens—with a man whose only, or, at any rate,
whose chief fault is that he consults his heart

twenty; very seldom more. And truths so
patriarchal as that are always shockingly
emaciated; yet it’s not till then that the
majority takes them up and recommends them
to society as wholesome food. I can assure you
there’s not much nutriment in that sort of fare;
you may take my word as a doctor for that. All
these majority-truths are like last year’s salt pork;
they’re like rancid, mouldy ham, producing all the

Do you think the brain of the poodle isn’t very

short; then he daren’t hold his own opinions, or
think out his own thoughts; then he turns the

I say it’s absolutely unpardonable of the <i>Messenger</i>
to proclaim, day out, day in, the false doctrine
that it’s the masses, the multitude, the compact
majority, that monopolise liberality and morality,—and
that vice and corruption and all sorts of

And yet this same <i>Messenger</i> can preach about
elevating the masses and the multitude to a higher

of the masses would simply mean hurling them
straight to perdition! But, happily, the notion
that culture demoralises is nothing but an old traditional
lie. No it’s stupidity, poverty, the ugliness
of life, that do the devil’s work! In a house that
isn’t aired and swept every day—my wife maintains
that the floors ought to be scrubbed too, but
perhaps that is going too far;—well,—in such a
house, I say, within two or three years, people lose
the power of thinking or acting morally. Lack of
oxygen enervates the conscience. And there
seems to be precious little oxygen in many and
many a house in this town, since the whole compact

the Liberals are the craftiest foes free men have

of all young and living truths; that considerations
of expediency turn justice and morality
upside down, until life here becomes simply

of smaller animals a year, if he’s to exist at all.
Just look at Hovstad and Aslaksen! How many
small animals they polish off—or at least mangle
and maim, so that they’re fit for nothing else but
to be house-owners and subscribers to the <i>People’s

the hum of conversation and laughter of many
voices are heard; a glass is tapped with a knife;
silence follows, and a toast is proposed; shouts of
“Bravo!” and then again a buzz of conversation.</i></p>

no cause to complain. At first, as you may guess,
I felt it a little strange. It was such a totally new

<p class='c001'>Yes, you surely knew that, didn’t you? Where
do you suppose I found the money to learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>photography, and to furnish a studio and make a

you.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, my dear fellow, didn’t you know? I

about it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not a word about <em class='gesperrt'>his</em> part in the business. He
must have forgotten it. Our correspondence has
always been purely a business one. So it was my
father that——!</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certainly. He didn’t wish it to be
generally known; but he it was.  And of course
it was he, too, that put me in a position to marry.
Don’t you—don’t you know about that either?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, I haven’t heard a word of it. [<i>Shakes him
by the arm.</i>] But, my dear Hialmar, I can’t tell
you what pleasure all this gives me—pleasure, and
self-reproach. I have perhaps done my father
injustice after all—in some things. This proves
that he has a heart. It shows a sort of compunction——</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, yes—whatever you like to call it. Oh, I
can’t tell you how glad I am to hear this of father.—So
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>you are a married man, Hialmar! That is

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, exactly. But, my dear friend, I'm quite

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Who has risen.</i>] Oh yes, he mentioned it; but
not that—— [<i>Walking about the room.</i>] Stay—perhaps
he did—now that I think of it. My
father always writes such short letters. [<i>Half

me, Hialmar—this is interesting—how did you
come to know Gina—your wife?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>The simplest thing in the world. You know
Gina did not stay here long; everything was so
much upset at that time, owing to your mother’s
illness and so forth, that Gina was not equal to it
all; so she gave notice and left. That was the
year before your mother died—or it may have
been the same year.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was the same year. I was up at the works
then. But afterwards——?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, Gina lived at home with her mother,
Madam Hansen, an excellent hard-working
woman, who kept a little eating-house. She
had a room to let too; a very nice comfortable
room.</p>

it?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; in fact, it was your father that recommended
it to me. So it was there, you see, that
I really came to know Gina.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And then you got engaged?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. It doesn’t take young people long to fall

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Rises and moves about a little.</i>] Tell me: was it
after your engagement—was it then that my

take up photography?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, precisely. I wanted to make a start, and
to set up house as soon as possible; and your
father and I agreed that this photography business
was the readiest way. Gina thought so too. Oh,
and there was another thing in its favour, by-the-bye:
it happened, luckily, that Gina had learnt
to retouch.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, quite. And there are such lots of

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Indeed?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, there are big cupboards full of books; and
a great many of the books have pictures in them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And there’s an old bureau with drawers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>flaps, and a big clock with figures that go out and
in. But the clock isn’t going now.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

<p class='c001'>So time has come to a standstill in there—in the

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. And then there’s an old paint-box and
things of that sort; and all the books.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh yes, when I get the chance. Most of them
are English though, and I don’t understand
English. But then I look at the pictures.—There
is one great big book called “Harrison’s History
of London.”<a id='r16' /><a href='#f16' class='c013'><sup>[16]</sup></a> It must be a hundred years old;
and there are such heaps of pictures in it. At the
beginning there is Death with an hour-glass and
a woman. I think that is horrid. But then there
are all the other pictures of churches, and castles,
and streets, and great ships sailing on the sea.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But tell me, where did all those wonderful things
come from?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh, an old sea captain once lived here, and he
brought them home with him. They used to call
him “The Flying Dutchman.” That was curious,
because he wasn’t a Dutchman at all.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. But at last he was drowned at sea; and
so he left all those things behind him.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Tell me now—when you are sitting in there looking
at the pictures, don’t you wish you could travel
and see the real world for yourself?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Oh no! I mean always to stay at home and

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No, not only that. I should love above everything
to learn to engrave pictures like those in the
English books.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I don’t think father likes it; father is strange
about such things. Only think, he talks of my
learning basket-making, and straw-plaiting! But
I don’t think <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> would be much good.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But father was right in saying that if I had

<p class='c001'>Oh, they look after it, and build places for it,

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I see; for no doubt the wild duck is by far the

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hedvig.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, indeed she is; for she is a <em class='gesperrt'>real</em> wild fowl,
you know. And then she is so much to be pitied;
she has no one to care for, poor thing.</p>

</div>

<p class='c001'>No. The hens too, many of them, were

<p class='c001'>That is father’s old gun. It’s of no use now;
something has gone wrong with the lock. But it’s
fun to have it all the same; for we can take it to

screw it together again.—Of course, it’s mostly

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes. I will rescue the shipwrecked man. For
shipwrecked he was, by the very first blast of the
storm. Even while those terrible investigations
were going on, he was no longer himself. That
pistol there—the one we use to shoot rabbits with—has
played its part in the tragedy of the house
of Ekdal.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>When the sentence of imprisonment was passed—he

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

<p class='c001'>Had he——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes; but he dared not use it. His courage
failed him. So broken, so demoralised was he
even then! Oh, can you understand it? He, a
soldier; he, who had shot nine bears, and who
was descended from two lieutenant-colonels—one
after the other of course. Can you understand
it, Gregers?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I cannot. And once more the pistol played a
part in the history of our house. When he had
put on the grey clothes and was under lock and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>key—oh, that was a terrible time for me, I can
tell you. I kept the blinds drawn down over both
my windows. When I peeped out, I saw the sun
shining as if nothing had happened. I could not
understand it. I saw people going along the
street, laughing and talking about indifferent
things. I could not understand it. It seemed to
me that the whole of existence must be at a
standstill—as if under an eclipse.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I felt like that too, when my mother died.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It was in such an hour that Hialmar Ekdal
pointed the pistol at his own breast.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But you did not fire?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No. At the decisive moment I won the victory
over myself. I remained in life. But I can assure
you it takes some courage to choose life under
circumstances like those.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, that depends on how you look at it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, indeed, it takes courage. But I am glad I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>was firm: for now I shall soon perfect my invention;
and Dr. Relling thinks, as I do myself, that
father may be allowed to wear his uniform again.
I will demand that as my sole reward.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>So <em class='gesperrt'>that</em> is what he meant about his uniform——?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, that is what he most yearns for. You can’t
think how my heart bleeds for him. Every time
we celebrate any little family festival—Gina’s and
my wedding-day, or whatever it may be—in comes
the old man in the lieutenant’s uniform of happier
days. But if he only hears a knock at the door—for
he daren’t show himself to strangers, you
know—he hurries back to his room again as fast
as his old legs can carry him. Oh, it’s heartrending
for a son to see such things!</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>How long do you think it will take you to
finish your invention?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Come now, you mustn’t expect me to enter into
particulars like that. An invention is not a
thing completely under one’s own control. It
depends largely on inspiration—on intuition—and
it is almost impossible to predict when the inspiration
may come.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But it’s advancing?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Yes, certainly, it is advancing. I turn it over in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>my mind every day; I am full of it. Every afternoon,
when I have had my dinner, I shut myself
up in the parlour, where I can ponder undisturbed.
But I can’t be goaded to it; it’s not a bit of good;
Relling says so too.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>And you don’t think that all that business in
the garret draws you off and distracts you too
much?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>No no no; quite the contrary. You mustn’t
say that. I cannot be everlastingly absorbed in
the same laborious train of thought. I must have
something alongside of it to fill up the time of
waiting. The inspiration, the intuition, you see—when
it comes, it comes, and there’s an end of it.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>My dear Hialmar, I almost think you have something
of the wild duck in you.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Something of the wild duck? How do you
mean?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>You have dived down and bitten yourself fast in
the undergrowth.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Are you alluding to the well-nigh fatal shot that
has broken my father’s wing—and mine too?</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Not exactly to <em class='gesperrt'>that</em>. I don’t say that your wing
has been broken; but you have strayed into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>poisonous marsh, Hialmar; an insidious disease has
taken hold of you, and you have sunk down to die
in the dark.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>I? To die in the dark? Look here, Gregers,
you must really leave off talking such nonsense.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Don’t be afraid; I shall find a way to help you
up again. I too have a mission in life now; I
found it yesterday.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>That’s all very well; but you will please leave
<em class='gesperrt'>me</em> out of it. I can assure you that—apart from
my very natural melancholy, of course—I am as
contented as any one can wish to be.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Your contentment is an effect of the marsh
poison.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Now, my dear Gregers, pray do not go on about
disease and poison; I am not used to that sort
of talk. In my house nobody ever speaks to me
about unpleasant things.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It’s not good for me you see. And there <em class='gesperrt'>are</em>
no marsh poisons here, as you express it. The poor
photographer’s roof is lowly, I know—and my circumstances
are narrow. But I am an inventor,
and I am the breadwinner of a family. That exalts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>me above my mean surroundings.—Ah, here comes

us, you see. Now he can talk to me as openly as
a child. He has never had the chance to do that
before. Fancy a man like him, full of health and
vigour, passing his whole youth and the best years
of his life in listening to nothing but penitential
sermons! And very often the sermons had for
their text the most imaginary offences—at least

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>[<i>Somewhat impatiently.</i>] Yes, of course I am.

  <div class='nf-center'>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>It is that—but I don’t know whether I ought

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Because it is clearly the case. Isn’t the
marriage between your father and Mrs. Sörby
founded upon complete confidence, upon entire
and unreserved candour on both sides? They
hide nothing from each other, they keep no
secrets in the background; their relation is based,
if I may put it so, on mutual confession and absolution.</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Hialmar.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>Well, is not that the whole thing? Did you
not yourself say that this was precisely the
difficulty that had to be overcome in order to
found a true marriage?</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div><span class='sc'>Gregers.</span></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c001'>But this is a totally different matter, Hialmar.

wife with those two——?  Oh, you understand
me well enough.</p>

<p class='c001'>I have had my eyes opened. Just you notice;—you’ll
see, the deed of gift is only a beginning.
Mrs. Sörby has always been a good deal taken
up with Hedvig; and now she has the power to

take her from me whenever they please.</p>

I have loved her so unspeakably! I would have
counted it my highest happiness to take her tenderly
by the hand and lead her, as one leads a
timid child through a great dark empty room!—I
am cruelly certain now that the poor photographer
in his humble attic has never really and
truly been anything to her. She has only cunningly
contrived to keep on a good footing with
him until the time came.</p>

you have far too much faith in the claim of the

with the glamour of wealth about them, and called
to the child:—“Leave him: come to us: here life

<p class='c001'>There are quite a few instances of missing punctuation. The
conventional period following the character’s name is sometimes
missing and has been added for consistency’s sake without
further comment. Those missing from setting and stage direction
are also added without comment, since there is no obvious purpose to be
served by the omission. However, the restoration of punctuation
missing from dialogue is noted below, since the punctuation is
frequently expressive. Several instances of dubious ‘?’ marks have
been corrected, based on context.</p>

<p class='c001'>As noted below, on p. <a href='#Page_62'>62</a>, there is apparently a missing word in the
phrase ‘And even&nbsp;&nbsp;it were so...’, most likely ‘if’.</p>

<p class='c001'>Volume I of this series included errata for each succeeding volume,
and noted the following for Volume VIII. Each of these was corrected
in printing.</p>

<p class='c001'>Other errors deemed most likely to be the printer’s have been corrected, and
are noted here. The references are to the page and line in the original.</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
